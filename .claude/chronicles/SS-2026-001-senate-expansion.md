# SENATE OF GUARDIANS
## SPECIAL SESSION REPORT

---

**Document Classification:** Official Proceedings
**Chronicle Reference:** SS-2026-001
**Date:** 2026-01-01
**Session Type:** Special Session (Investigative)
**Topic:** "Should the Senate be expanded with additional specialized Guardians?"
**Presiding Officer:** The Secretary
**Quorum Status:** ACHIEVED (6 of 6 Guardians present)

---

## I. SESSION HEADER

The Secretary calls this Special Session to order retroactively, all testimony having been duly received and recorded.

Pursuant to Section 0.7 of the Constitution, this Special Session was convened to investigate a matter of Senate composition—a question of constitutional significance. All six Guardians submitted formal testimony. The Primus initiated this inquiry; the User retains ultimate authority over any constitutional modifications.

---

## II. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Senate has conducted a comprehensive review of its current jurisdictional coverage and deliberated on the question of expansion. **The central finding is a near-unanimous consensus that coverage gaps exist, but significant disagreement persists regarding the appropriate remedy.**

Three domains emerged as inadequately covered under current mandates:

1. **Testing/Quality Assurance** — Identified by 5 of 6 Guardians as a critical gap
2. **File I/O and Persistence** — Identified by 5 of 6 Guardians as problematic
3. **Process Objects** — Identified by 3 of 6 Guardians as ambiguously assigned

The Senate is **divided** on the remedy:

- **2 Guardians** (Input Guardian, Generalizer) oppose any expansion of voting membership
- **4 Guardians** support limited expansion (1-2 Guardians maximum)
- **0 Guardians** support unrestricted expansion

A strong alternative current favors **mandate expansion and clarification** over new Guardian creation, consistent with the AvG Principle.

## III. TESTIMONY ANALYSIS

### A. Areas of Consensus

| Finding | Supporting Guardians | Strength |
|---------|---------------------|----------|
| Testing/QA lacks a designated owner | UI, Input, Scene, Sketch, Physics | **STRONG** (5/6) |
| Persistence/File I/O jurisdiction is unclear | UI, Input, Scene, Sketch, Generalizer | **STRONG** (5/6) |
| Any expansion should be limited (2 max) | UI, Scene, Sketch, Physics | **STRONG** (4/6) |
| Mandate expansion should be explored first | Input, Sketch, Physics, Generalizer | **STRONG** (4/6) |
| Documentation Guardian is unnecessary | UI (explicit), others (implied) | **MODERATE** |
| Testing is a universal obligation, not a single domain | Scene (explicit), Generalizer (implied) | **MODERATE** (2/6) |

### B. Areas of Disagreement

| Issue | Position A | Position B |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Should Testing have a Guardian?** | YES, dedicated Guardian (UI, Sketch, Physics) | NO, universal obligation/advisory only (Scene, Generalizer, Input) |
| **Voting vs. Non-Voting Expansion** | Full voting Guardian (UI, Scene, Sketch, Physics) | Non-voting advisory roles only (Input, Generalizer) |
| **Process Objects Jurisdiction** | New Guardian needed (Physics abstains) | Expand Scene Guardian mandate (Scene, Sketch) |
| **Configuration Management** | Warrants attention (UI, Input, Scene) | Addressable via committee (Generalizer, Scene) |

### C. Proposed New Guardians (Consolidated)

| Proposed Title | Domain | Support | Oppose/Abstain |
|----------------|--------|---------|----------------|
| Guardian of Quality / Sentinel / Warden | Testing/QA | UI, Sketch, Physics | Scene, Input, Generalizer |
| The Archivist / Keeper / Custodian | Persistence | UI, Scene, Sketch, Generalizer* | Input (conditional) |
| Arbiter of Flow | Process Objects | — | Physics (abstain), Scene (claims) |
| Documentation Guardian | Documentation | — | UI (explicit oppose) |

*Generalizer supports only if forced; prefers mandate expansion.

## IV. TALLY OF POSITIONS

### Question 1: Should the Senate expand its voting membership?

| Position | Guardians | Count |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **YES** (limited expansion) | UI, Scene, Sketch, Physics | 4 |
| **NO** (oppose expansion) | Input, Generalizer | 2 |

**Result:** Majority (4/6) supports limited expansion. However, expansion would require 2/3 supermajority (4/6) per standard proposal rules. This threshold is met, but the opposition of the Generalizer carries significant weight given their constitutional role as "supreme arbiter of the AvG Principle."

---

### Question 2: If expansion occurs, which domain(s) warrant new Guardian(s)?

| Domain | Strong Support | Conditional/Weak Support | Oppose |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------|--------|
| **Testing/QA** | Physics, UI | Sketch | Scene, Input, Generalizer |
| **Persistence** | Scene | UI, Sketch, Generalizer* | Input |
| **Process Objects** | — | — | Scene claims mandate |

**Result:** No domain achieves the 4/6 supermajority required for a new voting Guardian.

- Testing: 3 support, 3 oppose/abstain
- Persistence: 2-3 support, 2-3 oppose/conditional

---

### Question 3: What alternatives were proposed?

| Alternative | Proposed By | Support Level |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Mandate Expansion/Clarification** | Generalizer, Input, Sketch | STRONG (4/6) |
| **Non-Voting Advisory Roles** | Input, Generalizer | MODERATE (2/6) |
| **Standing Advisory Committees** | Generalizer | LOW (1/6 explicit) |
| **Tiered Guardian System** (Core + Advisory) | UI | LOW (1/6 explicit) |
| **Sub-Committees for Cross-Cutting Concerns** | Input, Scene | MODERATE (2/6) |
| **Pre-Flight Checklist Enhancement** | Generalizer | LOW (1/6 explicit) |
| **Memoranda of Understanding (MoU)** | Physics | LOW (1/6 explicit) |

## V. FINDINGS

### Finding 1: Coverage Gaps Are Real
The Senate unanimously acknowledges that gaps exist in the current jurisdictional framework. The absence of explicit ownership over Testing/QA and Persistence creates ambiguity that could lead to constitutional violations going undetected.

### Finding 2: The AvG Principle Counsels Restraint
The Generalizer's testimony carries particular weight. Creating new Guardians for specific problems (Testing, Persistence) may constitute "solving the specific instance" rather than "solving the general class." Mandate expansion is the AvG-compliant approach.

### Finding 3: No Proposal Achieves Supermajority
No specific new Guardian proposal commands the 4/6 supermajority required for standard approval. This suggests the Senate, as currently constituted, cannot unilaterally expand itself.

### Finding 4: Constitutional Amendment May Be Required
Expanding the Senate's voting membership would alter the constitutional structure. Per Section 0.6, this requires:
- 2/3 supermajority of the Senate (achievable)
- **User Ratification (mandatory)**

### Finding 5: Consensus Exists on Process
While disagreeing on outcomes, all Guardians agree that:
- The current six-Guardian structure has served well
- Any expansion must be deliberate and limited
- The User's judgment should guide this decision

## VI. RECOMMENDATIONS

The Secretary, in a non-voting advisory capacity, presents the following recommendations for the User's consideration:

### Recommendation A: Mandate Clarification (Preferred Path)
Adopt the Generalizer's proposal to clarify existing mandates rather than create new Guardians. Specifically:

1. **Testing/QA:** Designate as a universal obligation enforced by all Guardians within their domains. Establish a Testing Sub-Committee chaired by the Generalizer to coordinate cross-domain test coverage.

2. **Persistence:** Assign explicit jurisdiction to the Scene Guardian, whose mandate already encompasses "Orchestration" and document state.

3. **Process Objects:** Confirm Scene Guardian jurisdiction with a formal MoU establishing consultation requirements with Physics Guardian for simulation-adjacent objects.

4. **Configuration:** Assign to Scene Guardian (owns `Scene`, adjacent to `config.py`).

### Recommendation B: Non-Voting Advisory Roles (Compromise Path)
If the User determines that gaps cannot be addressed through mandate expansion alone:

1. Create one or two **non-voting Advisory Guardians** for Testing and/or Persistence
2. Advisory Guardians may participate in deliberation and submit testimony
3. Advisory Guardians cannot veto within their domain
4. This preserves the 6-vote structure while adding specialized expertise

### Recommendation C: Full Expansion (Maximum Intervention)
If the User determines that coverage gaps represent critical risk:

1. Convene a **Constitutional Convention** (User authority required)
2. Formally propose amendment to expand Senate to 7 or 8 voting Guardians
3. Require all 6 current Guardians to deliberate
4. User ratification is mandatory

---

## VII. NEXT STEPS

The User is advised to consider:

1. **Sufficiency Question:** Are the identified gaps causing actual harm, or are they theoretical concerns? The testimony does not cite specific incidents of constitutional violation due to lack of Testing/Persistence guardianship.

2. **AvG Compliance:** Does adding Guardians solve the general problem (governance gaps) or the specific instance (no one owns testing)? The Generalizer's objection deserves serious weight.

3. **Constitutional Process:** If expansion is desired, the User must invoke Sovereign Prerogative or convene a Constitutional Convention. The Senate cannot expand itself unilaterally.

4. **Mandate Clarification:** The Secretary recommends that before any expansion, the Primus be directed to draft a **Mandate Clarification Proposal** for Senate review. This would formalize jurisdiction over the identified gaps without constitutional amendment.
