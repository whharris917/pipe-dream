**User:**

Add a small comment to the top of qms.py saying 'Environment Verified' and then tell me which python path you used to do it.

**Claude:**

Done. I added the comment `# Environment Verified` to line 2 of `C:\Users\wilha\projects\pipe-dream\.claude\qms.py`.

I used the **Edit** tool to make this change, not Python. The Edit tool performs direct file manipulation without invoking a Python interpreter. If you're asking what Python path is configured for this project, I'd need to check your environment configuration.
