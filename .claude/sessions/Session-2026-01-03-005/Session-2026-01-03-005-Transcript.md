/ide()

**Claude:**

I notice you typed `/ide()` which isn't a recognized command. 

If you're looking for help with IDE integrations for Claude Code, I can look that up for you. Or if you meant something else, please let me know what you're trying to do.

Common commands you might be looking for:
- `/help` - Get help with Claude Code
- `/qms` - Run QMS commands for this project

What would you like to do?
