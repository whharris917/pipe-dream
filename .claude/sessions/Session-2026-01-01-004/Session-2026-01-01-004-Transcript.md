# Convening Special Session of the Senate

As The Primus, I hereby convene a **Special Session** of the Senate of Guardians.

**Topic:** *Should the Senate be expanded with additional specialized Guardians?*

**Session Type:** Special Session (Non-proposal deliberation)
**Quorum Required:** 3 Guardians
**Convened By:** The Primus

---

I shall now spawn the Secretary to facilitate proceedings, followed by the full Senate for deliberation on this constitutional matter.

**User:**

Please ensure the secretary understands its role as facilitator, not spawner of sub-agents.

---

**The Primus:**

You're correct. As The Primus, **I** am responsible for agent lifecycle (spawning/terminating). The Secretary facilitates proceedings but does not spawn agents.

Let me proceed correctly:

1. **First:** I will spawn all six Guardians in parallel to gather their testimony
2. **Then:** I will spawn the Secretary to compile the testimonies and produce the formal session report

---

## Gathering Guardian Testimony

---

**The Primus:**

All six Guardians have submitted their testimony. Now I shall spawn the Secretary to compile the formal session report.

---

**The Primus:**

## Special Session Complete

The Secretary has compiled the official Session Report. Let me save it to the Chronicle and provide you with a summary.

## Key Findings

### Coverage Gaps Identified (Consensus)
| Gap | Severity | Guardian Support |
|-----|----------|------------------|
| Testing/QA | CRITICAL | 5/6 agree it's unowned |
| Persistence/File I/O | HIGH | 5/6 agree jurisdiction unclear |
| Process Objects | MEDIUM | 3/6 note ambiguity |

### Senate Division on Remedy

| Position | Guardians |
|----------|-----------|
| **Support limited expansion** (1-2 max) | UI, Scene, Sketch, Physics (4) |
| **Oppose expansion** (mandate clarification instead) | Input, Generalizer (2) |

**Critical Note:** No specific new Guardian proposal achieved the 4/6 supermajority required. The Generalizer invoked the AvG Principle, arguing that adding Guardians is "the specific fix" while mandate expansion is "the general fix."

---

## Secretary's Recommendations

**Path A (Preferred):** Mandate Clarification
- Assign Persistence explicitly to Scene Guardian
- Make Testing a universal obligation with a coordinating sub-committee
- Formalize Process Objects under Scene Guardian via MoU

**Path B (Compromise):** Non-Voting Advisory Roles
- Add 1-2 Advisory Guardians (no veto power, participation only)
- Preserves 6-vote structure

**Path C (Maximum):** Constitutional Convention
- Formally amend to add voting Guardians
- Requires User ratification

---

## Your Decision Required

As Sovereign, you may:
1. **Accept Recommendation A** - Direct the Primus to draft Mandate Clarification amendments
2. **Accept Recommendation B** - Authorize creation of non-voting Advisory roles
3. **Accept Recommendation C** - Convene a Constitutional Convention for full expansion
4. **Table the matter** - No action at this time

# Matter Tabled

**Chronicle Reference:** SS-2026-001
**Disposition:** TABLED by Sovereign Decree

---

The User, exercising sovereign prerogative, has ordered the matter of Senate expansion **tabled indefinitely**.

The current six-Guardian structure remains in effect:

| Guardian | Domain |
|----------|--------|
| UI Guardian | UI/Widgets/Rendering |
| Input Guardian | Events/Focus/Modals |
| Scene Guardian | Orchestration/Undo |
| Sketch Guardian | CAD/Geometry |
| Guardian of Physics | Physics/Compiler/CFD/Numba |
| The Generalizer | Architecture/AvG |

The coverage gaps identified (Testing, Persistence, Process Objects) remain noted in the Chronicle for future consideration. No constitutional amendments will be pursued at this time.

The session report remains on file at `.claude/chronicles/SS-2026-001-senate-expansion.md` should this matter be revisited.
