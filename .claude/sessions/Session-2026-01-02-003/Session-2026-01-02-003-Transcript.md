**Claude:**

I've read the CLAUDE.md file. This is the technical architecture guide for **Flow State** (Pipe Dream), a hybrid CAD + particle physics application.

**Key architectural principles I'll follow:**

1. **Air Gap Compliance** - UI never mutates the model directly; all changes go through `scene.execute()` with Commands
2. **Two Domains** - Sketch (CAD geometry/constraints) and Simulation (particle physics) are strictly separated
3. **Command Pattern** - Every state mutation needs `execute()` and `undo()` for history/replay
4. **State Classification**:
   - *Persistent* ("The Vault") → Commands required
   - *Transient* ("The Lobby") → Direct access OK (camera, selection, etc.)
5. **4-Layer Input Protocol** - System → Global → Modal → HUD
6. **QMS Governance** - SOPs in `SDLC/SOPs/` define review procedures

**Pre-implementation checklist I'll use:**
- AvG Check (generalize, don't hack)
- Air Gap Check (use Commands)
- Surgical Precision (minimum viable mutation)
- Root Cause Analysis (cure the disease, not symptoms)
- Dependency Check (use protocols to decouple)

Ready to work on this codebase. What would you like to tackle?
