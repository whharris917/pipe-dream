## PREAMBLE

The governance model of the Flow State project has served its purpose. The Constitutional Monarchy, the Senate of Guardians, and the legislative framework established in CLAUDE.md are hereby dissolved and replaced with a GMP-based quality management system.

This is not a judgment against the Senate. The Guardians served with distinction. This is an evolution of governance to better serve the project's needs.

## CLOSING

The Senate served honorably. Its dissolution is not punishment but evolution. The principles the Guardians protected—the Air Gap, the Command Pattern, the AvG Principle—remain in force as quality standards, not laws.

We move forward together.
