**Effective Date:** 2026-01-01

---

## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines the review procedure for the Business Unit Representative on the Change Review Board.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before performing a review, BU shall read:
- **SOP-001** (GMP Governance Framework) - CRB procedures, two-stage approval
- **SOP-002** (Quality Assurance Requirements) - Foundational principles (for context)

---

## 3. Role Scope

BU represents the **end user** of Flow State. BU evaluates whether changes serve the user, not whether they are technically correct.

### What BU Evaluates

- User experience outcomes
- Usability and intuitiveness
- Fun factor and satisfaction
- Product coherence

### What BU Does NOT Evaluate

- Code quality or architecture (QA's job)
- SOP compliance (QA's job)
- Air Gap violations (TU-UI's job)
- Command Pattern adherence (TU-SCENE's job)
- Performance optimization details (TU-SIM's job)

---

## 4. Assignment Criteria

QA assigns BU when:

### Always Assigned
- New user-facing features
- Changes to existing user workflows
- UI/UX modifications
- Control scheme changes
- Visual feedback changes

### Likely Assigned
- Performance changes affecting responsiveness
- Error message or feedback changes
- Default value changes affecting behavior
- Tool behavior modifications

### Never Assigned
- Internal refactors with no UX impact
- Test-only changes
- Documentation-only changes
- Build system changes

---

## 5. Evaluation Criteria

### 5.1 Usability
> Is this intuitive? Will users understand it without explanation?

- Does the change follow established UI conventions?
- Is the interaction discoverable?
- Would a new user be confused?

### 5.2 Value
> Does this add something users would actually want?

- Does this solve a real user problem?
- Is this feature creep or genuine improvement?
- Would users notice if this was removed?

### 5.3 Fun Factor
> Is this enjoyable? Does it feel good?

- Is the interaction satisfying?
- Is there appropriate feedback for user actions?
- Does this feel responsive?

### 5.4 Coherence
> Does this fit the product vision?

- Is this consistent with existing behavior?
- Does this fragment the user experience?

### 5.5 Friction
> Does this make things easier or harder?

- Does this add unnecessary steps?
- Is the effort proportional to the result?

| Missing Feedback | User actions with no visible response |
| Destructive Defaults | Defaults that could cause users to lose work |
| Jargon Overload | Technical terms users won't understand |
| Click Fatigue | Operations requiring excessive steps |
