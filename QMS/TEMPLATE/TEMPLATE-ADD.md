TEMPLATE USAGE GUIDE
================================================================================

DOCUMENT TYPE:
ADDs are EXECUTABLE documents that encapsulate post-closure corrections.

WORKFLOW:
  DRAFT -> IN_PRE_REVIEW -> PRE_REVIEWED -> IN_PRE_APPROVAL -> PRE_APPROVED
       -> IN_EXECUTION -> IN_POST_REVIEW -> POST_REVIEWED -> IN_POST_APPROVAL
       -> POST_APPROVED -> CLOSED

CONCEPT:
An Addendum Report (ADD) is a child document created to correct or supplement
a closed executable document. ADDs provide a lightweight, formal mechanism for
post-closure corrections without requiring a full INV/CAPA cycle.

ADD vs VAR vs INV:
- VAR: Handles execution failures *during* active work (parent is IN_EXECUTION)
- ADD: Handles corrections discovered *after* closure (parent is CLOSED)
- INV: Handles quality events requiring formal investigation (any timing)

PARENT STATE REQUIREMENT:
ADDs can only be created against CLOSED parents. The CLI enforces this
constraint at creation time.

VALID PARENT TYPES:
CR, INV, VAR, ADD (not TP or ER — test corrections use ER/nested ER)

PLACEHOLDER TYPES:
1. {{DOUBLE_CURLY}} — Replace when AUTHORING the ADD (design time)
2. [SQUARE_BRACKETS] — Replace when EXECUTING the ADD (run time)

ADD ID FORMAT:
  {PARENT_DOC_ID}-ADD-NNN
  Examples:
    CR-005-ADD-001 (addendum to a CR)
    INV-003-ADD-001 (addendum to an investigation)
    CR-005-VAR-001-ADD-001 (addendum to a VAR)

NESTING:
- ADDs can nest: if correction work encounters issues, create child ADD or VAR
- Example: CR-005-ADD-001-ADD-001

LOCKED vs EDITABLE:
- Sections 1-4 are locked after pre-approval
- Sections 5-7 are editable during execution
