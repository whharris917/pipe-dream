# CR-006: SOP-001 Permission Matrix Update - Grant QA Route Permission

## 1. Purpose

Update SOP-001 Section 4.2 Permission Matrix to grant QA the `route` permission, aligning the procedure with the CLI implementation delivered in CR-005.

---

## 2. Scope

This change affects:
- **SOP-001** Section 4.2 Permission Matrix

---

## 3. Rationale

CR-005 updated `qms.py` to grant QA the `route` permission (allowing QA to route documents for review or approval). However, the corresponding SOP-001 permission matrix was not updated. This CR corrects that discrepancy.

**Background:** INV-001 identified this as a scope deviation in CR-005's execution.
