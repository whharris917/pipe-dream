## 2. Verification Objective

> Verify that compiled VR output renders step subsections with labeled sections, blockquoted instructions, and consistent formatting across all response types

## 3. Prerequisites

> qms-cli branch cr-097 checked out at commit d73f154 in .test-env/qms-cli/. TEMPLATE-VR.md present in seed/templates/. Python 3.x with pytest available.

## 4. Verification Steps

### 4.1 Step 1

**Instructions:**

> Compile a sample VR with 2 steps using the execution branch code and inspect the step subsection output for labels, blockquote instructions, and consistent formatting. Run: cd .test-env/qms-cli && python -c "<compilation script>"

*-- claude, 2026-02-22 18:52:16*

**Expected:**

> Each step subsection should have four labeled sections: **Instructions:**, **Expected:**, **Actual:**, **Outcome:**. Instructions content should be blockquoted (> prefix), not bold-wrapped. Attribution lines should appear on separate lines below blockquotes, not inside them. No **Do thing** bold-wrapped instructions should appear.

*-- claude, 2026-02-22 18:52:28*

**Actual:**

```
### 4.1 Step 1

**Instructions:**

> Compile a VR and inspect output

**Expected:**

> Labels and blockquotes present

*-- claude, 2026-02-22 18:52:53*

**Actual:**

```

**Outcome:**

> Pass

## 5. Summary
```

*-- claude, 2026-02-22 18:53:06 | commit: 68861cc*

**Outcome:**

> Pass. All four labels present (**Instructions:**, **Expected:**, **Actual:**, **Outcome:**). Instructions blockquoted with > prefix. Attribution on separate lines. No bold-wrapped instruction content. Formatting consistent across step subsection.

## 5. Summary

> Pass

*-- claude, 2026-02-22 18:53:42*

> Compiled a sample VR document with step data using the cr-097 branch code. Verified that all three rendering defects are fixed: step subsections now have labeled sections, instructions use blockquote formatting, and attribution lines render correctly. Output is consistent with the Objective and Prerequisites sections of compiled VRs.
