# CR-009: Create SOP-003 (Deviation Management) and SOP-004 (Document Execution)

## 1. Purpose

Create two new Standard Operating Procedures to formalize deviation management and document execution workflows, closing documentation gaps identified by INV-001.

---

## 2. Scope

This CR creates the following new controlled documents:

| Document | Title | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| SOP-003 | Deviation Management | Govern investigations (INV) and corrective/preventive actions |
| SOP-004 | Document Execution | Govern the execution phase of all executable documents |

**Out of Scope:**
- IN_AMENDMENT status and `amend` CLI command (deferred to follow-up CR)
- Modifications to existing SOPs (SOP-001, SOP-002)

---

## 3. Rationale

### Problem Identified

INV-001 revealed that while the QMS has procedures for document control (SOP-001) and change control (SOP-002), it lacks formal procedures for:

1. **Deviation Management** — No SOP governs when/how to create investigations, what root cause analysis entails, or how CAPAs function as execution items
2. **Execution Phase Control** — No SOP defines the "executable block" concept, scope change control during execution, or evidence requirements

### Lessons from INV-001

CR-005 closed with incomplete scope because:
- Scope items were silently dropped without formal documentation
- "Different execution mechanism" was treated as scope exclusion
- No procedural requirement existed to verify full scope completion

These issues were addressed tactically (CR-006, CR-007, CR-008), but the underlying procedures need to exist.

### Proposed Solution

Create two SOPs that formalize:
- **SOP-003:** Deviation types, when to investigate, root cause analysis, CAPA management
- **SOP-004:** Execution block structure, scope change control, evidence requirements, progress tracking

## 5. Proposed Content: SOP-003 (Deviation Management)

### 5.1 Purpose
Establish procedures for identifying, investigating, and resolving deviations from established procedures or expected product behavior.

### 5.2 Scope
Applies to all deviations identified during development, including:
- Procedural deviations (procedure not followed, gap in procedure, error in effective procedure)
- Product deviations (code bugs, unexpected behavior, design flaws)

### 5.3 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Deviation | Departure from approved procedure or expected product behavior |
| Procedural Deviation | A problem with a procedure as approved, or with the actual use of a procedure |
| Product Deviation | A problem with the product itself (e.g., code bug, design flaw) |
| Root Cause | Fundamental reason for a deviation |
| Corrective Action | Action to eliminate cause of existing deviation |
| Preventive Action | Action to eliminate cause of potential future deviation |
| CAPA | Corrective and Preventive Action — a category of execution item within an INV |

### 5.4 When to Create an Investigation

Not all deviations require an Investigation. The Lead has discretion to determine when an INV is warranted. General guidance:

- **INV warranted:** Root cause is not immediately obvious; issue is systemic; problem is significant enough to require formal corrective/preventive actions
- **INV not warranted:** Root cause is obvious and fix is straightforward; isolated issue with no systemic implications

QA provides oversight during review:
- When reviewing an INV, QA may determine "this INV is not needed" if the issue does not warrant formal investigation
- When reviewing a CR, QA may determine "this CR points to systemic issues that should be addressed via an investigation"

**Note:** The judgment and discernment of all agents (human and AI) is integral to making the QMS function well. Not every scenario can be codified; appropriate application of these guidelines requires thoughtful assessment.

### 5.5 Investigation Structure

An INV shall contain:
- **Background:** Context and circumstances of the deviation
- **Evidence:** Facts, observations, and data relevant to the deviation
- **Findings:** What was discovered during investigation
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Analysis to identify the fundamental cause(s)
- **CAPAs:** Corrective and preventive actions as execution items

### 5.6 Root Cause Analysis

Root cause analysis should identify the fundamental reason(s) for a deviation, distinguishing symptoms from underlying causes. The depth and methodology of RCA is left to the judgment of the investigator and reviewers. The goal is thoroughness appropriate to the deviation's significance.

### 5.7 CAPAs as Execution Items

CAPAs are not standalone documents. They are execution items within Investigations, numbered as `INV-XYZ-CAPA-NNN`.

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Corrective Action | Eliminate the cause of an existing deviation and/or remediate the consequences of the deviation having occurred |
| Preventive Action | Eliminate the cause of a potential future deviation; continuous improvement of the QMS |

All INVs require CAPAs. CAPAs do not exist outside of INVs. If a problem is significant enough to require CAPAs, then an INV is needed.

CAPAs may spawn child CRs to implement specific changes. The parent-child relationship is tracked via document references. It is incumbent on the Quality Unit to ensure that child CRs reference their parent CAPAs. A CAPA (as an EI in an INV) must be verified as complete by having its child CR(s) referenced in the EI and confirmed as closed. CAPA completion is a prerequisite to closure of the INV.

### 5.8 Closure Criteria

An INV may be closed when:
- Root cause(s) have been identified
- All CAPAs are complete (child CRs, if any, must be closed)
- Evidence is documented

---

## 6. Proposed Content: SOP-004 (Document Execution)

### 6.1 Purpose
Govern the execution phase of all executable documents (CR, INV, TP, ER), including scope management, progress tracking, and evidence requirements.

### 6.2 Scope
Applies to execution phase of:
- Change Records (CR)
- Investigations (INV)
- Test Protocols (TP)
- Exception Reports (ER)

Note: CAPAs are not standalone documents; they are execution items within INVs (see SOP-003).

### 6.3 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Executable Block | Section of an executable document where implementation work is recorded |
| Execution Item (EI) | Discrete unit of work within the executable block |
| Evidence | Documentation proving completion of an execution item |

### 6.4 The Executable Block

- Located after pre-approved content (Purpose, Scope, Rationale, Plan)
- Contains both static fields (e.g., test step instructions) and editable fields (e.g., execution details, evidence)
- Static fields are defined at document creation and are never editable
- Editable fields are where execution work is recorded

### 6.5 Document States During Execution

| State | Executable Block (Editable Fields) | Pre-Approved Content |
|-------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|
| PRE_APPROVED | Blank and locked | Locked |
| IN_EXECUTION | Editable | Locked |
| POST_REVIEWED | Editable (during review cycles) | Locked |
| CLOSED | Sealed | Sealed |

Note: The executable block structure (static fields) exists from document creation. Only the editable fields change state as described above.

### 6.6 Scope Integrity (Key lesson from INV-001)

Pre-approved scope items must be completed. If obstacles arise during execution:

1. **Complete the item as planned**, OR
2. **Document an exception** via ER with rationale explaining why the item cannot be completed and how the situation will be resolved

**Critical:** "Different execution mechanism" is NOT a scope exclusion. If scope was approved, it must be addressed.

### 6.7 Progress Tracking

Execution items are tracked in table format:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| EI | Execution item identifier |
| Description | What the item accomplishes |
| Status | PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE, BLOCKED |
| Evidence | Documentation of completion |
| Follow-up | Reference to related documents if applicable |

### 6.8 Evidence Requirements

- Each COMPLETE item requires documented evidence
- Evidence types: commit hash, document ID, test result, screenshot
- BLOCKED items require explanation and resolution path

### 6.9 Exception Reports (ER)

Created when execution encounters unexpected issues that prevent completion of scope items:
- Issue description
- Impact assessment
- Resolution or disposition

## 7. Testing Summary

Manual verification that:
1. SOP-003 is created and contains all sections from outline
2. SOP-004 is created and contains all sections from outline
3. Both SOPs reference each other appropriately
4. Both SOPs complete review/approval workflow
5. Both SOPs reach EFFECTIVE status before CR post-review

---

## 8. Dependencies

- CR-008 is EFFECTIVE (establishes post-review requirements this CR must follow)
- SOP-001 and SOP-002 provide foundational definitions referenced by new SOPs

---

## 9. Deferred Items

The following are explicitly out of scope for a follow-up CR:
- **IN_AMENDMENT status:** New document state for post-closure corrections
- **`amend` CLI command:** Command to transition CLOSED documents to IN_AMENDMENT
- **SOP-001 Section 8.2 update:** Add IN_AMENDMENT to status definitions

**Rationale:** Keep this CR focused on establishing the foundational procedures. Amendment functionality can be added incrementally after the base procedures exist.
