# CR-016: SOP and Template Cross-Validation Alignment

## 1. Purpose

Align SOPs and document templates to ensure cross-consistency between procedural requirements and template structures. This CR addresses discrepancies identified during cross-validation of the six SOPs against the six document templates.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

- **Parent Document:** None (independent improvement identified during Session-2026-01-07-004)

### 2.2 Changes Summary

This CR implements three coordinated changes:

1. **SOP-002 / CR-TEMPLATE:** Restructure CR content requirements with improved section organization
2. **SOP-004:** Add "Proposed Corrective Action" to ER content requirements
3. **SOP-003 / INV-TEMPLATE:** Restructure INV content requirements and create matching template

### 2.3 Files Affected

**SOPs:**
- `QMS/SOP/SOP-002.md` — Section 6 (CR Content Requirements)
- `QMS/SOP/SOP-003.md` — Section 5 (Investigation Structure)
- `QMS/SOP/SOP-004.md` — Section 9.2 (ER Content)

**Templates:**
- `.claude/workshop/templates/CR-TEMPLATE.md` — Complete restructure
- `.claude/workshop/templates/INV-TEMPLATE.md` — New file

---

## 3. Rationale

The previous session (Session-2026-01-07-003) harmonized SOPs internally and templates internally. Cross-validation revealed:

1. **CR terminology mismatch:** SOP-002 used "Description" while CR-TEMPLATE used "Scope" with different sub-structure
2. **CR missing sections:** Template had "Implementation Plan" not required by SOP
3. **ER missing section:** Template had "Proposed Corrective Action" not listed in SOP-004
4. **No INV template:** SOP-003 defined INV structure but no template existed

These discrepancies create ambiguity for document authors and reviewers. Aligning them ensures consistent document creation and review.

---

## 4. Implementation Plan

### 4.1 CR Structure (SOP-002 Section 6 + CR-TEMPLATE)

The new CR structure separates orientation (Scope, Context, Current/Proposed State) from detail (Change Description) and adds explicit Impact Assessment:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| 1. Purpose | What problem does this solve? |
| 2. Scope | Brief overview of affected system(s)/functionality |
| 3. Context | Parent document references (if applicable) |
| 4. Current State | Concise declarative statement(s), present tense |
| 5. Proposed State | Concise declarative statement(s), present tense |
| 6. Change Description | Full details, no rigid structure |
| 7. Justification | Why is this change needed? |
| 8. Impact Assessment | Files Affected, Documents Affected, Other |
| 9. Testing Summary | Brief description of testing approach |
| 10. Implementation Plan | EI table or executable blocks |
| 11. Execution Comments | Free-form comments, VAR attachments |
| 12. Execution Summary | Overall narrative after completion |
| 13. References | Related documents |

### 4.2 ER Content (SOP-004 Section 9.2)

Add "Proposed Corrective Action" to the required ER content list, positioned between Root Cause and Re-test Section:

- Exception Identification
- Detailed Description
- Root Cause
- **Proposed Corrective Action** ← new
- Exception Type
- Re-test Section
- ER Closure

### 4.3 INV Structure (SOP-003 Section 5 + INV-TEMPLATE)

Replace current SOP-003 Section 5 with structure mirroring CR organization:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| 1. Purpose | Why this investigation exists |
| 2. Scope | Affected system(s)/functionality |
| 3. Background | Context, what happened, when discovered |
| 4. Description of Deviation(s) | Full details of the deviation(s) |
| 5. Impact Assessment | Effect on systems, documents, other |
| 6. Root Cause Analysis | Why it happened |
| 7. Remediation Plan (CAPAs) | EI table/blocks for corrective/preventive actions |
| 8. Execution Comments | Free-form comments, VAR attachments |
| 9. Execution Summary | Overall narrative after completion |
| 10. References | Related documents |

Create INV-TEMPLATE matching this structure.

---

## 5. Testing Summary

- Manual verification that updated SOPs and templates are internally consistent
- Manual verification that SOP requirements match template sections
- Review of existing effective CRs to confirm new structure doesn't invalidate historical documents (historical documents are grandfathered)

---

## 6. Execution

| EI | Task Description | Execution Summary | Task Outcome | Performed By — Date |
|----|------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| EI-1 | Update SOP-002 Section 6 with new CR content requirements | Replaced Section 6 with new 12-section structure (6.1-6.12). SOP-002 v5.1 checked in. | Pass | claude — 2026-01-08 |
| EI-2 | Update CR-TEMPLATE to match new SOP-002 Section 6 structure | Restructured template with 12 sections matching SOP-002. Updated TEMPLATE USAGE GUIDE. | Pass | claude — 2026-01-08 |
| EI-3 | Update SOP-004 Section 9.2 to add Proposed Corrective Action | Added "Proposed Corrective Action" to ER content list. SOP-004 v2.1 checked in. | Pass | claude — 2026-01-08 |
| EI-4 | Update SOP-003 Section 5 with new INV structure | Replaced Section 5 with new 10-section structure (5.1-5.10). SOP-003 v1.1 checked in. | Pass | claude — 2026-01-08 |
| EI-5 | Create INV-TEMPLATE matching SOP-003 Section 5 | Created `.claude/workshop/templates/INV-TEMPLATE.md` with 10 sections matching SOP-003 Section 5. | Pass | claude — 2026-01-08 |
| EI-6 | Cross-verify all SOP/template pairs for consistency | Verified: SOP-002↔CR-TEMPLATE (12 sections), SOP-003↔INV-TEMPLATE (10 sections), SOP-004↔ER-TEMPLATE (7 elements, reordered to match). | Pass | claude — 2026-01-08 |

---

### Execution Comments

| Comment | Performed By — Date |
|---------|---------------------|
| During EI-6 cross-verification, discovered ER-TEMPLATE had "Proposed Corrective Action" (Section 5) after "Exception Type" (Section 4), but SOP-004 Section 9.2 specifies Proposed Corrective Action BEFORE Exception Type. Reordered ER-TEMPLATE sections to match SOP. | claude — 2026-01-08 |

---

## 7. Execution Summary

All 6 execution items completed successfully. Three SOPs were updated and are now EFFECTIVE:

| Document | Final Version | Key Change |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| SOP-002 | v6.0 EFFECTIVE | Section 6 restructured with 12-section CR content requirements |
| SOP-003 | v2.0 EFFECTIVE | Section 5 restructured with 10-section INV content requirements |
| SOP-004 | v3.0 EFFECTIVE | Section 9.2 updated to include Proposed Corrective Action |

Three templates were updated (outside QMS control, in `.claude/workshop/templates/`):

| Template | Change |
|----------|--------|
| CR-TEMPLATE | Restructured to match SOP-002 Section 6 (12 sections) |
| INV-TEMPLATE | Created new, matching SOP-003 Section 5 (10 sections) |
| ER-TEMPLATE | Reordered sections to match SOP-004 Section 9.2 |

Cross-verification confirmed all SOP/template pairs are now aligned. One minor deviation from plan: ER-TEMPLATE section order was corrected during cross-verification (EI-6) rather than being pre-identified as a discrepancy.
