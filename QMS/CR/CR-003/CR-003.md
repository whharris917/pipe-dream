# CR-003: Update SOP-001 for simplified routing flags

## 1. Purpose

Update SOP-001 (Quality Management System - Document Control) to reflect simplified CLI routing flags for executable documents. The `--pre-review`, `--post-review`, `--pre-approval`, and `--post-approval` flags have been removed; the CLI now automatically infers the pre/post phase from the document's current status.

---

## 2. Scope

This change affects documentation only. The following sections of SOP-001 require updates:

- Section 9.1/9.2: Review and Approval Workflow routing commands
- Section 10.2: Executable document workflow diagram
- Section 13: CLI Command Reference table

---

## 3. Changes

### 3.1 Old Behavior (Removed)

```bash
qms --user {USER} route {DOC_ID} --pre-review     # Explicit pre-review
qms --user {USER} route {DOC_ID} --post-review    # Explicit post-review
qms --user {USER} route {DOC_ID} --pre-approval   # Explicit pre-approval
qms --user {USER} route {DOC_ID} --post-approval  # Explicit post-approval
```

### 3.2 New Behavior

```bash
qms --user {USER} route {DOC_ID} --review    # Pre/post inferred from status
qms --user {USER} route {DOC_ID} --approval  # Pre/post inferred from status
```

**Inference Logic:**
- `--review` from DRAFT → IN_PRE_REVIEW
- `--review` from IN_EXECUTION → IN_POST_REVIEW
- `--approval` from PRE_REVIEWED → IN_PRE_APPROVAL
- `--approval` from POST_REVIEWED → IN_POST_APPROVAL

### 3.3 Rationale

Simplifies CLI usage by eliminating redundant flags. The document's current status already determines which phase (pre or post) applies, so explicit specification is unnecessary.

---

## 4. Execution Plan

### Pre-Execution
1. Checkin CR-003 and route for review
2. QA reviews CR-003
3. Route CR-003 for approval
4. QA approves CR-003
5. Release CR-003 for execution

### Execution
6. Checkout SOP-001
7. Update routing command examples in Section 9.1/9.2
8. Update workflow diagram annotations in Section 10.2
9. Update CLI Command Reference table in Section 13
10. Checkin SOP-001
11. Route SOP-001 for review and approval
12. SOP-001 becomes EFFECTIVE

### Post-Execution
13. Route CR-003 for post-review
14. QA reviews execution results
15. Route CR-003 for post-approval
16. QA approves CR-003
17. Close CR-003
