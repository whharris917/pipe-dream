# CR-030: Restructure pipe-dream into submodules

## 1. Purpose

Restructure the pipe-dream repository to separate concerns between the QMS Project, the QMS CLI tool, and the Flow State application by extracting qms-cli and flow-state into independent git repositories managed as submodules within pipe-dream.

This restructuring solves the testing paradox: agents can branch flow-state for code testing without affecting the governance layer (SOPs, inboxes, CRs).

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

Independent improvement identified during architectural review. The current monolithic structure prevents qms-cli reusability and creates governance instability during code testing.

- **Parent Document:** None

### 2.2 Changes Summary

- Extract `qms-cli/` into a standalone git repository
- Extract Flow State code (`core/`, `engine/`, `model/`, `ui/`, `main.py`, etc.) into a standalone git repository named `flow-state`
- Convert pipe-dream from a monolithic repo to a QMS Project containing submodule references
- Preserve all git history (no history loss)

### 2.3 Files Affected

- `.gitmodules` - Create (submodule configuration)
- `qms-cli/` - Convert to submodule reference
- `flow-state/` - Create as submodule (containing extracted code)
- `core/`, `engine/`, `model/`, `ui/`, `main.py`, etc. - Remove from direct tracking (moved to flow-state)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Update with new project structure

---

## 3. Current State

The pipe-dream repository is a monolithic git repo containing:
- QMS CLI tool code (`qms-cli/`)
- Flow State application code (`core/`, `engine/`, `model/`, `ui/`, `main.py`)
- QMS controlled documents (`QMS/`)
- QMS project configuration (`.claude/users/`, `.claude/agents/`)

All components share a single git history. Branching for code testing affects the governance layer.

---

## 4. Proposed State

The pipe-dream repository serves as the QMS Project root, containing:
- QMS controlled documents (`QMS/`)
- QMS project configuration (`.claude/`)
- Submodule reference to `qms-cli` (standalone git repo)
- Submodule reference to `flow-state` (standalone git repo)

Each component has independent git history. Agents can branch flow-state without affecting QMS documents or inbox state.

---

## 5. Change Description

### 5.1 Repository Structure

**Before:**
```
pipe-dream/                     # Single git repo
├── qms-cli/                    # Tool code (tracked directly)
├── QMS/                        # Controlled documents
├── .claude/                    # Users, agents, config
├── core/                       # Flow State code (tracked directly)
├── engine/
├── model/
├── ui/
└── main.py
```

**After:**
```
pipe-dream/                     # Git repo (QMS Project)
├── .gitmodules                 # Submodule configuration
├── qms-cli/                    # Submodule → github.com/.../qms-cli
├── flow-state/                 # Submodule → github.com/.../flow-state
├── QMS/                        # Stays in pipe-dream
└── .claude/                    # Stays in pipe-dream
```

### 5.2 History Extraction

Use `git subtree split` or `git filter-repo` to extract subdirectories with their history:

**qms-cli extraction:**
- Extract commits touching `qms-cli/` files
- Rewrite paths (`qms-cli/qms.py` → `qms.py`)
- Push to new `qms-cli` repository

**flow-state extraction:**
- Extract commits touching `core/`, `engine/`, `model/`, `ui/`, `main.py`, and related files
- Rewrite paths to root level
- Push to new `flow-state` repository

### 5.3 History Preservation

- pipe-dream retains complete original history (all commits from day 1)
- Extracted repos contain copies with rewritten paths (different commit hashes)
- Old CRs reference pipe-dream commits; new CRs reference respective repo commits
- No information is lost; navigation requires knowing the transition point

### 5.4 SDLC-QMS Location

SDLC-QMS (QMS CLI qualification documents) remains in `QMS/SDLC-QMS/` within pipe-dream. The QMS Project governs qms-cli externally via submodule.

### 5.5 Submodule Workflow

After restructuring:
- Clone pipe-dream with `--recurse-submodules` to get all code
- Work on flow-state: `cd flow-state && git checkout -b feature-branch`
- QMS documents in pipe-dream remain on main branch, unaffected
- Update submodule pointer when ready: `cd .. && git add flow-state && git commit`

---

## 6. Justification

- **Testing paradox:** Currently, branching for code testing moves SOPs and inbox tasks. Agents cannot safely test code changes without governance instability.
- **qms-cli reusability:** The tool is hardcoded to pipe-dream's structure. Extraction enables future portability to other projects.
- **Separation of concerns:** Code changes and governance changes should have independent commit streams.
- **Impact of not changing:** Continued inability to test code safely; qms-cli remains non-portable; interleaved history grows increasingly complex.

---

## 7. Impact Assessment

### 7.1 Files Affected

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `.gitmodules` | Create | Submodule configuration for qms-cli and flow-state |
| `qms-cli/` | Modify | Convert from directory to submodule reference |
| `flow-state/` | Create | New submodule containing extracted code |
| `core/` | Delete | Moved to flow-state repo |
| `engine/` | Delete | Moved to flow-state repo |
| `model/` | Delete | Moved to flow-state repo |
| `ui/` | Delete | Moved to flow-state repo |
| `main.py` | Delete | Moved to flow-state repo |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Modify | Update project structure documentation |

### 7.2 Documents Affected

| Document | Change Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| CLAUDE.md | Modify | Update to reflect new structure, submodule workflow |

### 7.3 Other Impacts

- **Clone instructions:** Contributors must use `git clone --recurse-submodules`
- **CI/CD:** May need updates if any automation assumes monolithic structure
- **Commit references:** Old CRs reference pipe-dream commits; transition documented in this CR

---

## 8. Testing Summary

- Verify pipe-dream clone with `--recurse-submodules` populates all directories
- Verify flow-state can be branched independently without affecting QMS/ or .claude/
- Verify qms-cli functions correctly from submodule location
- Verify old commits in pipe-dream can still be checked out (pre-transition state)
- Verify SDLC-QMS documents remain accessible and functional

---

## 9. Implementation Plan

### 9.1 Preparation

1. Create new empty repositories for qms-cli and flow-state (GitHub/remote)
2. Document the current HEAD commit of pipe-dream as the pre-transition reference point

### 9.2 Extract qms-cli

1. Clone pipe-dream to a working directory (preserve original)
2. Use `git filter-repo --subdirectory-filter qms-cli/` to extract qms-cli history
3. Push extracted history to new qms-cli repository
4. Tag the extraction point in qms-cli repo

### 9.3 Extract flow-state

1. Clone pipe-dream to a fresh working directory
2. Use `git filter-repo` with path filters for core/, engine/, model/, ui/, main.py, and related files
3. Push extracted history to new flow-state repository
4. Tag the extraction point in flow-state repo

### 9.4 Convert pipe-dream to submodules

1. In pipe-dream, remove qms-cli/ and flow-state code directories from tracking
2. Add qms-cli as submodule: `git submodule add <qms-cli-url> qms-cli`
3. Add flow-state as submodule: `git submodule add <flow-state-url> flow-state`
4. Commit the restructuring

### 9.5 Update Documentation

1. Update CLAUDE.md with new project structure
2. Document transition point and commit hash mapping
3. Update clone instructions

### 9.6 Validation

1. Fresh clone with `--recurse-submodules`
2. Verify all functionality works
3. Test branching flow-state independently

## 11. Execution Summary

All 6 execution items completed successfully. The pipe-dream repository has been restructured from a monolithic repo into a QMS Project with two submodules:

- **qms-cli**: Extracted with 287 commits of history using git subtree split
- **flow-state**: Extracted with full history using git filter-repo with multiple path filters

The .gitmodules file now references both submodules at their respective GitHub URLs. CLAUDE.md has been updated with the new project structure and all file path references updated to reflect the flow-state/ prefix.

Validation confirmed that both submodules populate correctly and that qms-cli functions from its new submodule location. Agents can now branch flow-state independently for code testing without affecting QMS documents or inbox state in pipe-dream.
