# CR-011: CAPA-001: Add revision_summary to SOP-005

## 1. Purpose

Correct the nonconformance identified in INV-002 by adding the required `revision_summary` field to SOP-005 frontmatter.

---

## 2. Scope

This change affects:
- **SOP-005** — Add `revision_summary` field to frontmatter

---

## 3. Rationale

**Nonconformance:**

INV-002 documented that SOP-005 was approved and made EFFECTIVE without the required `revision_summary` field in its frontmatter. This violates:
- SOP-001 Section 5.2 (document frontmatter requirements)
- SOP-002 Section 8 (CR traceability requirements)

**Corrective Action:**

Add the missing `revision_summary` field referencing CR-010, which was the authorizing CR for SOP-005's initial creation.

## 5. Proposed Change

**Current frontmatter:**

```

**Proposed frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
title: Code Governance
revision_summary: 'CR-010: Initial creation of Code Governance SOP'
---
```

---

## 6. Testing Summary

Manual verification that:
1. SOP-005 frontmatter contains `revision_summary` field
2. The field references CR-010 as the authorizing CR
3. Format complies with SOP-001 Section 5.2 and SOP-002 Section 8
