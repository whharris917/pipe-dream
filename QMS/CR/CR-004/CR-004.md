# CR-004: Require CR ID in revision summaries for traceability

## 1. Purpose

Establish traceability between document revisions and their authorizing Change Records by requiring the CR ID in the `revision_summary` frontmatter field.

## 2. Scope

This change affects:

- **SOP-001** Section 5.1 (Document Frontmatter) - Add CR ID requirement to revision_summary format
- **SOP-002** - Add traceability requirement linking document changes to CRs

## 3. Changes

### 3.1 Current State

The `revision_summary` field currently contains only a description of changes:

```yaml
revision_summary: Simplify routing flags; CLI now infers pre/post phase from document status
```

There is no formal link between the document revision and the CR that authorized it.

### 3.2 Proposed State

The `revision_summary` field must begin with the authorizing CR ID:

```yaml
revision_summary: "CR-004: Add traceability requirement for revision summaries"
```

**Format:** `CR-XXX: <description of changes>`

### 3.3 Rationale

- **Traceability:** Every document change can be traced back to its authorizing CR
- **Audit readiness:** Auditors can quickly identify the change control record for any revision
- **Historical context:** When reviewing document history, the CR provides full context (rationale, approvers, execution details)

### 3.4 Exceptions

- Initial document creation (v0.1) does not require a CR ID
- Documents created before this policy takes effect are grandfathered

## 4. Execution Plan

### Pre-Execution
1. Checkin CR-004 and route for review
2. QA reviews CR-004
3. Route CR-004 for approval
4. QA approves CR-004
5. Release CR-004 for execution

### Execution
6. Checkout SOP-001
7. Update Section 5.1 to specify CR ID format for revision_summary
8. Checkin SOP-001, route for review and approval
9. Checkout SOP-002
10. Add traceability section linking document changes to CRs
11. Checkin SOP-002, route for review and approval
12. Both SOPs become EFFECTIVE

### Post-Execution
13. Route CR-004 for post-review
14. QA reviews execution results
15. Route CR-004 for post-approval
16. QA approves CR-004
17. Close CR-004

## 5. Testing

Manual verification that:
- SOP-001 Section 5.1 specifies CR ID format
- SOP-002 contains traceability requirement
- Format example is clear and unambiguous
