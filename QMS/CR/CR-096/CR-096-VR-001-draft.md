## 1. Verification Identification

<!-- @prompt: related_eis | next: date -->

Which execution item(s) in the parent document does this VR verify? (e.g., EI-3, or EI-3 and EI-4)

<!-- @prompt: date | next: objective | default: today -->

| Parent Document | Related EI(s) | Date |
|-----------------|---------------|------|
| {{parent_doc_id}} | {{related_eis}} | {{date}} |

---

## 2. Verification Objective

<!-- @prompt: objective | next: pre_conditions -->

State what CAPABILITY is being verified -- not what specific mechanism is being tested. Frame the objective broadly enough that you naturally check adjacent behavior during the procedure.

Good: "Verify that service health monitoring detects running and stopped services correctly"
Avoid: "Verify the health check endpoint returns 200"

**Objective:** {{objective}}

---

## 3. Pre-Conditions

<!-- @prompt: pre_conditions | next: step_instructions -->

Describe the state of the system BEFORE verification begins. A person with terminal access but no knowledge of this project must be able to reproduce these conditions.

Include as applicable: branch and commit checked out, services running (which, what ports), container state, non-default configuration, data state, relevant environment details (OS, Python version, etc.).

## 4. Verification Steps

<!-- @loop: steps -->

### Step {{_n}}

<!-- @prompt: step_instructions | next: step_expected -->

What are you about to do? Describe the action and provide the exact command, click target, or navigation path. Commands must be copy-pasteable -- not retyped or abbreviated.

**{{step_instructions}}**

<!-- @prompt: step_expected | next: step_actual -->

What do you expect to observe? State this BEFORE executing -- not after. Good verification covers both sides: confirming what should be present and confirming what should be absent. A step might check that a service responds correctly, or that an error no longer appears, or that an unrelated subsystem remains unaffected. All of these are evidence.

**Expected:** {{step_expected}}

<!-- @prompt: step_actual | next: step_outcome | commit: true -->

What did you observe? Reference primary evidence: paste actual terminal output, or attach raw output via --respond --file. Do not summarize or paraphrase. If the output is long, paste the relevant portion and note what was omitted.

The commit hash recorded on this response pins the project state at the moment of observation. A verifier can checkout this commit to see the exact code, configuration, and any output files referenced below.

**Actual:**

```
{{step_actual}}
```

<!-- @prompt: step_outcome | next: more_steps -->

Did the observed output match your expectation? Pass or Fail. If Fail, note the discrepancy.

**Outcome:** {{step_outcome}}

<!-- @gate: more_steps | type: yesno | yes: step_instructions | no: summary_outcome -->

Do you have additional verification steps to record?

<!-- @end-loop: steps -->

## 5. Summary

<!-- @prompt: summary_outcome | next: summary_narrative -->

Considering all steps above, what is the overall outcome? Pass if all steps passed and nothing unexpected was observed. Fail if any step failed or if unexpected behavior was discovered.

**Overall Outcome:** {{summary_outcome}}

<!-- @prompt: summary_narrative | next: performer -->

Brief narrative overview of the verification: what was tested, the general approach, and any notable observations -- even if they don't affect the outcome. If any step failed, reference the discrepancy and any VAR created.

## 6. Signature

<!-- @prompt: performer | next: performed_date | default: current_user -->

Who performed this verification?

<!-- @prompt: performed_date | next: end | default: today -->

| Role | Identity | Date |
|------|----------|------|
| Performed By | {{performer}} | {{performed_date}} |

<!-- @end -->
