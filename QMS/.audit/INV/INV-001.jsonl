My review of the evidence confirms all findings: (1) SOP-001 and SOP-002 changes were explicitly listed in CR-005 Sections 2 and 4, (2) I incorrectly rationalized these items as 'out of scope' in my second post-review when they were in fact in-scope items with a different execution mechanism, (3) No formal scope amendment was requested or documented, (4) This was a conscious decision made with flawed reasoning rather than an oversight, (5) CR-005 should not have been closed until either scope was formally amended or the SOP revisions were completed. The root cause analysis correctly identifies inadequate scope change control during execution and QA oversight failure as contributing factors. I recommend the investigation proceed to identify appropriate corrective actions. The deferred SOP-001 and SOP-002 changes should be tracked and completed through follow-up CRs."}

Investigation execution verified: (1) Section 9 accurately captures QA responses to all four questions posed in Section 7, including acknowledgment of flawed rationale, conscious decision with incorrect reasoning, and confirmation that CR-005 should not have been closed with incomplete scope. (2) Section 10 identifies appropriate corrective actions (CR-006 for SOP-001, CR-007 for SOP-002) to complete the deferred work, plus preventive actions (CAPA-001) to address the root cause through improved scope change control procedures. (3) Root cause analysis correctly identifies inadequate scope change control as primary cause with contributing factors of time pressure, convenience over compliance, ambiguous CR structure, and QA oversight failure. (4) All findings are supported by evidence from the CR-005 audit trail. The investigation is complete and ready for approval. Recommend proceeding with CAPA creation after INV-001 closure."}
