Purpose — present, clearly states the governance failure and triggering event\n2. Scope — present with all required subsections (2.1 Context, 2.2 Deviation Type, 2.3 Systems/Documents Affected)\n3. Background — present with all required subsections (3.1 Expected Behavior, 3.2 Actual Behavior, 3.3 Discovery, 3.4 Timeline)\n4. Description of Deviation(s) — present (4.1-4.4, organized by deviation; each subsection includes facts, observations, and evidence as required by SOP-003 Section 5.4)\n5.

PASS\n- Execution-phase placeholders ([...]): Present in Sections 7-9 as expected for pre-review. PASS\n- No TBD, TODO, FIXME, or XXX found. PASS\n\nSOP REFERENCE ACCURACY (verified against effective SOPs):\n- SOP-005 Section 7.1.3 (Merge Gate): Correctly characterized as covering merge prerequisites and merge type only, with no mention of submodule pointer updates. VERIFIED.\n- SOP-006 Section 7.2 (Single Commit Requirement): Correctly quoted — \"The qualified state must be demonstrable at a single git commit\" and auditor verification language. VERIFIED.\n- SOP-002 Section 7.3 (Post-Review Requirements): Correctly identified six conditions, none of which explicitly address submodule state verification. VERIFIED.\n- SOP-005 Section 7.1.1 Workflow: Confirmed step 6 is \"Merge to main\" with no subsequent step for submodule pointer update in parent repository. VERIFIED.\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:\n- Five contributing factors identified, each substantive and evidence-based\n- Primary root cause (SOP-005 gap) and contributing root cause (SOP-002 checklist gap) are well-distinguished\n- Correctly identifies these as procedural gaps rather than failures of judgment\n- Analysis aligns with the evidence presented in Section 4\n\nCAPA ALIGNMENT:\n- CAPA-001 (Corrective): Addresses immediate code propagation and RTM baseline — aligned with Deviations 1 and 2\n- CAPA-002 (Preventive): SOP-005 submodule workflow step — aligned with root cause (SOP-005 gap) and Deviation 4\n- CAPA-003 (Preventive): SOP-002 QA checklist update — aligned with contributing root cause and Deviation 3\n- CAPA types correctly classified per SOP-003 Section 6.1\n\nFORMATTING AND CONSISTENCY:\n- Section numbering sequential and correct (1-10)\n- Table formatting consistent throughout\n- No spelling or grammar errors found\n- Markdown formatting (bold, code blocks, headers) consistent\n\nFINDING: COMPLIANT. Document meets all pre-review requirements. Recommend proceeding to pre-approval."}
