I acknowledge Finding 3 (QA Oversight): I reviewed and approved SOP-005 without detecting the missing revision_summary field. My review criteria included 'Document follows SOP format conventions' which I marked PASS despite the nonconformance. This was an oversight. The investigation is thorough: evidence is complete, root cause analysis identifies lack of systematic verification as primary cause, and proposed CAPAs are appropriate. I accept ownership of CAPA-002 (Enhance QA Review Checklist). Recommend pre-approval."}
