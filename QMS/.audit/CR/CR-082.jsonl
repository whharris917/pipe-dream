No missing sections.\n\nPLACEHOLDER CONTENT: No TBD, TODO, FIXME, or XXX found in pre-approved content. Execution-phase placeholders ([SUMMARY], [Pass/Fail], etc.) in the EI table and Execution Summary are appropriate per SOP-004 Section 5 (editable fields are blank until IN_EXECUTION).\n\nTRACEABILITY: INV-011 confirmed IN_EXECUTION (v1.2). CAPA-003 origin is valid. All referenced documents (SOP-001, SOP-002, SOP-004, SDLC-QMS-RS, SDLC-QMS-RTM) are valid.\n\nFORMATTING: Consistent section numbering, well-formed tables, consistent code block formatting. No typos detected.\n\nPLAN COMPLETENESS: 7 phases with 9 EIs provide adequate coverage. Phase-to-EI mapping is logical. Development controls (Section 7.4) and qualified state continuity (Section 7.5) follow established patterns.\n\nTESTING: 7 new qualification tests with clear descriptions. Full regression requirement (396+ tests) stated. Coverage appears adequate for the scope.\n\nSOP IMPACTS: Correctly identified SOP-001 (Sections 2, 3, 6.1, 8.2) and SOP-004 (Section 2, new Section 9B).\n\nPATTERN CONFORMANCE: ADD mirrors VAR structurally as stated. Semantic distinction (during-execution vs post-closure) is clear.\n\nFINDING (requires clarification):\n\nSection 5.1 states valid parent types are \"CR, INV, VAR, ADD (all executable types that reach CLOSED).\" However, TP and ER are also executable documents that reach CLOSED status. The parenthetical claim \"all executable types that reach CLOSED\" is inaccurate because TP and ER are excluded. The CR must either: (a) include TP and ER as valid parent types, or (b) explicitly state why TP and ER are excluded from valid parent types and remove the inaccurate parenthetical. This is a scope clarity issue — the current text creates ambiguity about whether the exclusion is intentional design or an oversight."}

The misleading parenthetical \"(all executable types that reach CLOSED)\" has been removed. The updated text now explicitly names the excluded types (TP, ER) and provides clear rationale: test-related corrections are handled by ER and nested ERs per SOP-004 Section 9; ADDs address non-test executable documents only. The design boundary is now unambiguous and consistent with Section 4 (Proposed State).\n\nFULL RE-VERIFICATION (no regressions):\n- Frontmatter: title = \"Implement ADD (Addendum) Document Type\"; revision_summary = \"Initial draft\" (acceptable for v0.1)\n- All 12 required sections per SOP-002 Section 6 present and correctly ordered\n- No TBD, TODO, FIXME, or XXX in pre-approved content\n- Execution-phase placeholders appropriate per SOP-004 Section 5\n- Traceability to INV-011 CAPA-003 confirmed\n- Formatting consistent, no typos detected\n- Section numbering sequential with no gaps\n- Files affected lists in Sections 2.3 and 7.1 are mutually consistent\n- 7 phases, 9 EIs, adequate test coverage (7 new tests + full regression)\n- SOP impacts correctly identified (SOP-001 Sections 2,3,6.1,8.2; SOP-004 Section 2, new 9B)\n- Development controls and qualified state continuity documented\n\nDocument is COMPLIANT.
