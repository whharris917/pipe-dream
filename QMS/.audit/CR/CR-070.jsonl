One deficiency found requiring correction.\n\nWORKFLOW VERIFICATION:\n- Audit trail confirms correct workflow sequence: DRAFT -> PRE_REVIEWED -> PRE_APPROVED (v1.0) -> IN_EXECUTION -> IN_POST_REVIEW (v1.2). Conforming.\n\nEXECUTION TABLE (Section 10):\n- All 7 EIs verified present with Task Outcome of Pass.\n- All 7 EIs have substantive Execution Summary content with specific evidence (file paths, line numbers, method names, test results).\n- All 7 EIs have signatures with dates.\n- No residual execution placeholders ([SUMMARY], [Pass/Fail], [PERFORMER], [DATE]) remain.\n- EI-7 performed by \"lead, claude\" confirming UAT was conducted.\n\nEXECUTION COMMENTS:\n- 2 substantive comments present, both signed and dated.\n- Comment 1: Syntax verification and import chain validation.\n- Comment 2: UAT findings (stale count, services display) with resolution.\n\nBLOCKING VARs: None. No Fail outcomes exist.\n\nDOCUMENTATION: Section 7.2 states no controlled documents affected. Confirmed.\n\nSDLC PREREQUISITES: Not applicable (agent-hub is not under SDLC governance).\n\nPRE-APPROVED CONTENT INTEGRITY: Sections 1-9 unchanged from pre-approved version. Confirmed.\n\nPLACEHOLDER CHECK: No residual execution placeholders, no TBD/TODO/FIXME/XXX. Confirmed.\n\nDEFICIENCY:\nSection 11 (Execution Summary), final sentence reads: \"Commit: f2c64ec (implementation), services.py fix uncommitted pending checkin.\"\n\nThis statement is factually inaccurate. Git log shows commit 54da65f (\"CR-070 IN_EXECUTION: UAT complete, services display fixes\") exists after f2c64ec, demonstrating the services.py fix WAS committed. The Execution Summary contains stale text that was not updated to reflect the final execution state.\n\nPer SOP-002 Section 7.3 item 4: \"Evidence Documented: Completion evidence is recorded in the CR's Execution Summary column.\" The Execution Summary must accurately reflect the final state of execution. A statement claiming code is \"uncommitted\" when it has in fact been committed is a documentation error.\n\nREQUIRED CORRECTION:\nUpdate Section 11 to reference both commits accurately. Suggested correction: replace \"Commit: f2c64ec (implementation), services.py fix uncommitted pending checkin\" with text referencing both f2c64ec and 54da65f with accurate descriptions of what each commit contains.\n\nAfter correction, re-route for post-review."}

Previously identified deficiency has been resolved.\n\nDEFICIENCY RESOLUTION:\nPrior deficiency: Section 11 contained stale text \"services.py fix uncommitted pending checkin\" when commit 54da65f existed.\nCurrent text: \"Commits: f2c64ec (implementation), 54da65f (UAT results and services display fixes).\"\nBoth commits are now accurately referenced with descriptions. Stale text removed. RESOLVED.\n\nDOCUMENT INTEGRITY:\nConfirmed only the final sentence of Section 11 was modified (the correction). Sections 1-9 (pre-approved), Section 10 (EI table), Execution Comments, and Section 12 (References) are all unchanged from the prior review.\n\nPOST-REVIEW CRITERIA (SOP-002 Section 7.3):\n1. Execution Complete: All 7 EIs show Task Outcome of Pass with signatures (claude - 2026-02-09; EI-7: lead, claude - 2026-02-09).\n2. Blocking VARs: None. No Fail outcomes exist.\n3. Documentation: No controlled documents affected (Section 7.2 states \"None\").\n4. Evidence Documented: All EIs contain specific evidence (file paths, line numbers, method names, test results). Execution Summary references commits f2c64ec and 54da65f.\n5. SDLC Prerequisites: N/A (agent-hub not under SDLC governance).\n\nADDITIONAL CHECKS:\n- No residual execution placeholders remain.\n- No TBD/TODO/FIXME/XXX found.\n- Pre-approved content (Sections 1-9) unchanged from pre-approved version.\n- Execution Comments: 2 substantive entries, both signed and dated.\n- Formatting consistent throughout.\n\nNO DEFICIENCIES FOUND.
