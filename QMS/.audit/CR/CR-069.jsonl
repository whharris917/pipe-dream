Execution documentation is entirely missing.\n\nFRONTMATTER:\n- title: \"Agent Hub Consolidation — Unify orchestration tools under agent-hub/\" -- present, non-empty.\n- revision_summary: \"Initial draft\" -- this value has not been updated since document creation. For an executable document at v1.0 that has completed execution, the revision_summary should reflect the execution state, not \"Initial draft.\"\n\nSTRUCTURE: All 12 required CR sections per SOP-002 Section 6 are present.\n\nPLACEHOLDER CONTENT: CRITICAL FINDING. The following execution-phase placeholders remain unresolved:\n\nSection 10 (Execution) EI Table -- ALL six rows contain placeholders:\n- EI-1: \"[SUMMARY]\", \"[Pass/Fail]\", \"[PERFORMER] - [DATE]\"\n- EI-2: \"[SUMMARY]\", \"[Pass/Fail]\", \"[PERFORMER] - [DATE]\"\n- EI-3: \"[SUMMARY]\", \"[Pass/Fail]\", \"[PERFORMER] - [DATE]\"\n- EI-4: \"[SUMMARY]\", \"[Pass/Fail]\", \"[PERFORMER] - [DATE]\"\n- EI-5: \"[SUMMARY]\", \"[Pass/Fail]\", \"[PERFORMER] - [DATE]\"\n- EI-6: \"[SUMMARY]\", \"[Pass/Fail]\", \"[PERFORMER] - [DATE]\"\n\nSection 10 Execution Comments Table:\n- \"[COMMENT]\", \"[PERFORMER] - [DATE]\"\n\nSection 11 (Execution Summary):\n- \"[EXECUTION_SUMMARY]\"\n\nPROCEDURAL NON-COMPLIANCE (SOP-002 Section 7.3):\nA CR may only be routed for post-review when ALL of the following are met:\n1. \"Execution Complete: All execution items have Task Outcome of Pass, or Fail outcomes are documented via Variance Report\" -- FAILED. No Task Outcomes are recorded. All six EIs show \"[Pass/Fail]\".\n2. \"Evidence Documented: Completion evidence is recorded in the CR's Execution Summary column\" -- FAILED. All six EIs show \"[SUMMARY]\" with no evidence.\n\nEVIDENCE OF EXECUTION:\nGit commit fcf077d (\"CR-069 IN_EXECUTION: Agent Hub Consolidation\") exists on main, confirming that code changes were implemented. However, this evidence has not been documented in the CR itself.\n\nREQUIRED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:\n1. Check out CR-069 and populate ALL six EI rows with: execution summaries describing what was done and referencing commit(s), Task Outcome (Pass/Fail), and performer/date.\n2. Complete the Execution Summary (Section 11) with an overall narrative.\n3. Either populate or remove the placeholder row in the Execution Comments table.\n4. Check in and re-route for post-review.\n\nDETERMINATION: NON-COMPLIANT. The CR was routed for post-review with zero execution documentation completed. One failed item is sufficient for rejection; this review identifies eight distinct placeholder violations across Sections 10 and 11."}

Pre-approved content (Sections 1-9) is intact and unmodified from pre-approval.\n\nPLACEHOLDER CONTENT: None found. Searched for TBD, TODO, FIXME, XXX, [SUMMARY], [Pass/Fail], [PERFORMER], [DATE], [COMMENT], [EXECUTION_SUMMARY] -- zero matches in the document.\n\nEXECUTION TABLE VERIFICATION (SOP-002 Section 7.3, SOP-004):\n- EI-1 (Phase 1: File moves): Pass. Summary documents git mv operations for docker/, agent-gui/, git_mcp/; creation of logs/.gitkeep; deletion of .claude/docker/, .pid, and .log files.\n- EI-2 (Phase 2: Path fixes): Pass. Summary documents config.py property additions, container.py path fixes (3 lines), docker-compose.yml volume mount updates, shell script rewrites. Validated with docker-compose config.\n- EI-3 (Phase 3: services.py and CLI): Pass. Summary documents services.py creation (~420 lines), 3 new CLI subcommands, 9 total subcommands verified via agent-hub --help, smoke test of agent-hub services.\n- EI-4 (Phase 4: Config/dependency/gitignore): Pass.

References commit fcf077d (73 files changed).\n\nAll six EIs have Task Outcome of Pass. No Fail outcomes, so no VARs required. No VARs found (confirmed via filesystem search).\n\nEXECUTION COMMENTS: Two comments recorded with performer/date signatures. First documents pre-execution service teardown. Second documents single-commit execution strategy.\n\nEXECUTION SUMMARY (Section 11): Complete narrative summarizing all six phases, noting no deviations from plan, and referencing verification evidence (docker-compose config, agent-hub --help, agent-hub services smoke test, commit fcf077d).\n\nEVIDENCE VERIFICATION (independent spot checks):\n- Commit fcf077d exists on main: confirmed. 73 files changed, 1519 insertions, 721 deletions.

No QMS-controlled documents (SOPs, RS, RTM) were modified under this CR.\n\nSDLC PREREQUISITES (SOP-002 Section 7.3 item 5): Not applicable.
