Execution phase placeholders in sections 10-12 are appropriate for pre-review stage. References include SOP-001, SOP-002, SOP-007, SDLC-QMS-RS, and SDLC-QMS-RTM. Section numbering is sequential and correct. No typos or formatting errors found. Development controls for SDLC-governed submodule are documented per established pattern (Section 7.4). Qualified state continuity plan is documented (Section 7.5). SDK verification chain in Section 5.2 provides evidence of technical feasibility. No TU assignment warranted — affected files are all infrastructure/QMS-layer components outside Flow State application domains. One operational note: document contains Unicode arrow characters (U+2192) in Section 5.2 that cause the MCP qms_read tool to fail on Windows charmap codec; this is not a document compliance issue but may warrant attention during execution."}
