Three deficiencies found during execution verification.\n\nFRONTMATTER VERIFIED:\n- title: 'Launch script Hub integration and obsolete file cleanup'\n- revision_summary: 'Initial draft' (acceptable for executable document per SOP-002 Section 8)\n\nDOCUMENT STRUCTURE: All 12 required sections per SOP-002 Section 6 are present. No placeholder content (TBD/TODO/FIXME) found. Section numbering correct. Formatting consistent.\n\nEXECUTION VERIFICATION - DEFICIENCIES FOUND:\n\n1. INCOMPLETE FIX IN docker/README.md (EI-5 claim inaccurate): EI-5 states 'Fixed stale references discovered in docker/README.md (inbox watcher troubleshooting).' The troubleshooting section (line 319-323) was indeed updated to reference the Agent Hub. However, lines 49 and 54 still contain stale references: Line 49: 'An inbox watcher that monitors all agent inboxes' and Line 54: 'Inbox watcher shows: [QA] New task: Review CR-056'. These describe the old standalone inbox watcher behavior rather than the Agent Hub. The multi-agent session description in docker/README.md was not updated to reflect the Hub integration.\n\n2. INCOMPLETE FIX IN CLAUDE.md (EI-4 claim inaccurate): EI-4 states 'Also fixed start-git_mcp.sh typo to start-git-mcp.sh (matching actual filename).' The directory tree listing at line 230 was correctly updated to show 'start-git-mcp.sh'. However, the command example at line 199 still reads: 'cd docker/scripts && ./start-git_mcp.sh' (underscore instead of hyphen). The actual filename on disk is 'start-git-mcp.sh' (confirmed via filesystem check). The typo fix was only partially applied.\n\n3. STALE COMMENT IN requirements.txt: Line 42 reads 'watchdog>=3.0.0  # Filesystem monitoring for inbox-watcher.py'. The referenced file docker/scripts/inbox-watcher.py was deleted in EI-1. The watchdog dependency may still be needed (the Hub inbox.py uses it), but the comment references a deleted file.\n\nITEMS VERIFIED AS CORRECT:\n- docker/scripts/ contains only mcp_proxy.py, start-mcp-server.sh, start-git-mcp.sh (confirmed)\n- All 8 ;C directories deleted (confirmed via find - none remain)\n- .inbox-watcher.log deleted (confirmed - file does not exist)\n- launch.sh correctly implements ensure_hub() with health check against :9000/api/health (confirmed)\n- CLAUDE.md directory tree listing correctly updated (lines 228-231)\n- hub.py correctly implements _container_sync_loop (10s polling) and _hub_managed set (confirmed at lines 246-274 and line 28)\n- docker/CONTAINER-GUIDE.md no longer references start-container.sh (confirmed)\n- docker/README.md troubleshooting section correctly references Agent Hub (lines 319-323)\n- No functional references to deleted files in launch.sh (confirmed)\n- EI table: 8 EIs, all with Task Outcome of Pass or Fail-then-fix, performed-by and dates recorded\n- No VARs required (EI-6 fail addressed by EI-7 fix and EI-8 re-test)\n\nDISPOSITION: The three deficiencies above must be corrected before approval. EI-5 and EI-4 execution summaries should also be updated to accurately reflect what was fixed, or the additional fixes should be noted in execution comments."}
