{"ts": "2026-02-16T02:48:51+00:00", "event": "REVIEW", "user": "qa", "version": "0.1", "outcome": "RECOMMEND", "comment": "PRE-REVIEW: COMPLIANT. All review criteria satisfied.\n\nFRONTMATTER: title = \"Project State Preservation, Rollback Procedures, and CR-085 Language Correction\"; revision_summary = \"Initial draft\" (acceptable for v0.1 per SOP-001 Section 5.1).\n\nSTRUCTURE: All 12 required CR sections present per SOP-002 Section 6. Sections 7.4/7.5 (Development Controls / Qualified State Continuity) correctly omitted for document-only CR. Subsection numbering consistent throughout.\n\nPLACEHOLDERS: No prohibited placeholders (TBD, TODO, FIXME, XXX, double-curly). Execution-phase square-bracket placeholders correctly present in Sections 10-11.\n\nCONTENT VERIFICATION:\n- Section 1 (Purpose): Clearly articulates three bundled concerns (CR-085 language fix, pre/post execution commit repositioning, SOP-005 rollback procedures).\n- Section 2 (Scope): Context, Changes Summary, and Files Affected all complete. Five files listed.\n- Section 3 (Current State): Verified against effective SOP-004 Section 5 — confirms \"QMS repository\" language exists and is inaccurate.\n- Section 4 (Proposed State): Clear target state for all three concerns.\n- Section 5 (Change Description): Six subsections with specific, implementable changes. SOP-004 rewrite, SOP-002 restructuring from 5 to 7 steps, SOP-002 Section 10 cross-reference, TEMPLATE-CR comment block update, SOP-005 Section 7.1.5 insertion, seed alignment.\n- Section 6 (Justification): Four points covering accuracy, traceability, gap closure, and history preservation.\n- Section 7 (Impact Assessment): Tables match Section 2.3. \"None\" for other impacts (document-only CR).\n- Section 8 (Testing Summary): Verification checklist with six specific items mapping to proposed changes. Appropriate for document-only scope.\n- Section 9 (Implementation Plan): Seven EIs with bookend commits (EI-1 pre-execution, EI-7 post-execution). Logical sequence.\n- Section 10 (Execution): Seven-row EI table matching plan. Static fields filled, editable fields contain execution-phase placeholders.\n- Section 12 (References): SOP-001, SOP-002, SOP-004, SOP-005, CR-085. All valid and relevant.\n\nTECHNICAL ACCURACY: Verified proposed changes against effective SOP-004, SOP-002, SOP-005, and TEMPLATE-CR. CR-085 language (\"QMS repository\") confirmed present. SOP-005 insertion point (between 7.1.4 and 7.2) confirmed correct. SOP-002 step reordering (release before pre-execution commit) is logically coherent — the commit becomes a formal EI with evidence rather than an informal prerequisite.\n\nFORMATTING: Consistent markdown throughout. Section numbering sequential. No typos or errors found.\n\nTRACEABILITY: CR-085 referenced as predecessor. All SOP cross-references verified.\n\nNO TU ASSIGNMENT REQUIRED: Document-only CR affecting procedural governance documents. No code changes, no domain-specific technical review needed."}
