All review criteria verified with evidence as follows:\n\nFRONTMATTER:\n- title: 'Inbox Watcher Notification Injection via tmux' -- present, non-empty\n- revision_summary: 'Initial draft' -- appropriate for v0.1; CR ID not required (self-authorizing executable document per SOP-002 Section 8)\n\nDOCUMENT STRUCTURE (per SOP-002 Section 6 / TEMPLATE-CR):\nAll 12 required sections present: (1) Purpose, (2) Scope with 2.1 Context / 2.2 Changes Summary / 2.3 Files Affected, (3) Current State, (4) Proposed State, (5) Change Description with subsections 5.1-5.4, (6) Justification, (7) Impact Assessment with 7.1-7.3, (8) Testing Summary, (9) Implementation Plan with phases 9.1-9.5, (10) Execution with EI table and Execution Comments, (11) Execution Summary, (12) References.\n\nSections 7.4 (Development Controls) and 7.5 (Qualified State Continuity) correctly omitted -- this CR modifies Docker infrastructure and agent definitions, not SDLC-governed controlled code.\n\nPLACEHOLDER COMPLIANCE:\n- No template placeholders found (all replaced)\n- No TBD, TODO, FIXME, or XXX found\n- Square bracket placeholders present only in execution sections (10, 11) -- correct for pre-execution phase\n\nTRACEABILITY:\n- Parent: CR-056-VAR-003 (verified PRE_APPROVED, Type 2 VAR) -- correctly referenced\n- CR-056 (verified CLOSED) -- correctly referenced as originating CR\n- SOP-001, SOP-002, SOP-004, CR-057 -- valid references\n\nCONTENT QUALITY:\n- Purpose clearly states the problem (notification injection gap) and origin (CR-056-VAR-003 EI-1)\n- Current/Proposed State use present tense, declarative statements\n- Change Description provides thorough technical detail including tmux architecture, send-keys mechanism, agent state handling table, and known limitations\n- Justification addresses problem, impact of inaction, and solution rationale\n- Testing Summary defines five specific, verifiable test cases (T1-T5)\n- Implementation Plan has five sequential phases with clear steps\n- EI table has five items mapping to the five implementation phases, conforming to SOP-004 Section 4.2\n\nFORMATTING:\n- Consistent heading hierarchy, horizontal rules, table formatting, code blocks\n- No formatting inconsistencies found\n\nTYPOS/ERRORS: None found.\n\nRTM QUALIFIED BASELINE: N/A (not a controlled code CR).\n\nREVIEWER ASSIGNMENT: No additional TUs assigned. This CR affects Docker infrastructure and agent definitions only; no Flow State application code domains are impacted.\n\nRecommendation: PROCEED TO APPROVAL."}
