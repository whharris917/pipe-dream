All post-execution review criteria verified with evidence per SOP-004 Section 10.\n\nFRONTMATTER:\n- title: 'Inbox Watcher Notification Injection via tmux' -- present, unchanged from pre-approved version\n- revision_summary: 'Initial draft' -- appropriate for executable document in execution phase\n\nPRE-APPROVED CONTENT INTEGRITY:\nSections 1-9 verified identical to pre-approved v1.0 content. No unauthorized modifications.\n\nEXECUTION ITEM COMPLETENESS (5/5):\n- EI-1: Pass. Evidence: commit fd05d8e, docker/Dockerfile +1 line (tmux added to apt-get install)\n- EI-2: Pass. Evidence: commit fd05d8e, launch.sh +2/-1 lines (tmux new-session integration)\n- EI-3: Pass. Evidence: commit fd05d8e, inbox-watcher.py +84/-12 lines (send_notification refactored to inject_notification with tmux send-keys)\n- EI-4: Pass. Evidence: commit fd05d8e, 6 agent files x +18 lines each (notification instructions added)\n- EI-5: Pass. Evidence: T1-T5 test results documented with specific observations. Performed by lead (independent test executor).\n\nCOMMIT VERIFICATION:\nCommit fd05d8e verified in git log. Commit message: 'CR-058 execution (EI-1 through EI-4): tmux notification injection for container agents'. File statistics align with claimed changes across all 9 affected files (Dockerfile, launch.sh, inbox-watcher.py, 6 agent definition files).\n\nEVIDENCE QUALITY (per SOP-004 Section 8):\nAll Pass outcomes have documented evidence. Commit hash is verifiable. Test narratives describe specific observations for each test case.\n\nFAIL OUTCOMES / VARs:\nNo Fail outcomes. No VARs filed. No blocking VARs to resolve.\n\nSCOPE INTEGRITY (per SOP-004 Section 6):\nAll 5 pre-approved scope items addressed. No items dropped. No unauthorized scope additions.\n\nEXECUTION SUMMARY (Section 11):\nComplete. Summarizes all EI outcomes, references commit fd05d8e, notes T4 design clarification (Claude Code native queue vs tmux buffering -- better than designed, no code change needed). States no deviations and no VARs.\n\nEXECUTION COMMENTS:\nOne comment documenting T4 observation. Factual, properly recorded with performer and date.\n\nPLACEHOLDER COMPLIANCE:\nNo execution-phase placeholders remain. All [SUMMARY], [Pass/Fail], [PERFORMER], [DATE], [COMMENT], and [EXECUTION_SUMMARY] replaced with actual values.\n\nTYPOS/ERRORS: None found.\nFORMATTING: Consistent throughout execution sections.\n\nRecommendation: PROCEED TO POST-APPROVAL."}
