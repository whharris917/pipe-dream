All five locations where the rename count appears (Sections 2.3, 5.4, 7.1, 8, and 9.4) now consistently state 'rename 3'. The distinction between 3 pure renames (behavior unchanged) and 1 rewrite (renamed and behavior changed) is clear and correctly counted separately throughout.\n\nFULL RE-VERIFICATION:\n\nFrontmatter:\n- title: 'Harden MCP Identity Management' -- present, non-empty.\n- revision_summary: 'Initial draft' -- acceptable for v0.1.\n\nStructure: All 12 SOP-002 required sections present (Purpose, Scope, Current State, Proposed State, Change Description, Justification, Impact Assessment, Testing Summary, Implementation Plan, Execution, Execution Summary, References), numbered 1-12.\n\nPlaceholder content: No prohibited placeholders (TBD, TODO, FIXME, XXX, {{}}) in pre-approved sections 1-9.

References to SOP-001, SOP-002, SOP-006, REQ-MCP-015, REQ-MCP-016 are appropriate.\n\nInternal consistency: All counts (delete 1, rename 3, add 5, rewrite 1, total 397/75) are consistent across Sections 2.3, 5.4, 7.1, 8, and 9.4. Net test arithmetic verified: 393-1+5=397, 71-1+5=75.\n\nFormatting: Consistent headers, tables, horizontal rules, and code formatting throughout.
