Verified frontmatter (title: 'QMS CLI Quality, State Machine, and Workflow Enforcement', revision_summary: 'Initial draft' -- acceptable for v0.1). All 12 CR sections per SOP-002 Section 6 present and complete. No placeholder content (TBD/TODO/FIXME/XXX) found; execution table template fields are appropriate for pre-review per SOP-004. Cross-references verified: SDLC-QMS-RS v13.0 EFFECTIVE, SDLC-QMS-RTM v15.0 EFFECTIVE, all referenced SOPs confirmed EFFECTIVE. Five bundled items share a sound consolidation rationale (common SDLC requalification boundary). Current/proposed state pairs are clear and unambiguous for all items. Change descriptions provide sufficient technical detail with file paths and line references. Testing summary addresses both automated and integration verification per SOP-002 Section 6.8. Implementation plan correctly gates merge on RS+RTM EFFECTIVE per SOP-006 Section 7.4. EI table (14 items) includes pre/post execution commits per SOP-004 Section 5. Development controls properly specify branch isolation, write protection, CI verification, and PR gate per SOP-005. No typos, formatting inconsistencies, or structural deficiencies found. Document is ready for pre-approval."}

Two deficiencies found requiring correction before approval:\n\nDEFICIENCY 1 - EI-14 EXECUTION SUMMARY CONTRADICTS TASK OUTCOME: EI-14 Execution Summary reads 'Pending — this commit will be made after CR-087 execution table is complete.' but Task Outcome is 'Pass'. A task described as pending cannot have a Pass outcome. The post-execution commit (SOP-004 Section 5) must be completed and the actual commit hash recorded in the Execution Summary before Task Outcome can be set to Pass.\n\nDEFICIENCY 2 - FRONTMATTER revision_summary NOT UPDATED: The frontmatter reads 'revision_summary: Initial draft'. This document is at v1.1 (execution phase). Per SOP-001 Section 5.1, revision_summary shall describe the changes in the current revision cycle. 'Initial draft' was appropriate for v0.1 but has not been updated.\n\nVERIFICATION COMPLETED (items that passed):\n- Frontmatter title: 'QMS CLI Quality, State Machine, and Workflow Enforcement' (present, non-empty)\n- EI-1 through EI-13: All 13 have execution summaries, Pass outcomes, and performer/date signatures\n- All EI commit hashes verified against qms-cli git log (033355b, 15bfd21, f2ac8ee, c719f82, 4c4b40d, 76bafc8, 6976e7f, 572339e)\n- CI run 22075060264 previously verified (Success status)\n- Test counts consistent: 416 total (218 qualification + 198 unit)\n- SDLC prerequisites: RS v14.0 EFFECTIVE, RTM v17.0 EFFECTIVE (confirmed via qms status)\n- Execution comments document two deviations: inlined auto-withdraw/auto-checkin instead of shared function; integration verification via qualification tests\n- Execution summary accurately describes 14 EIs, 5 improvements, one deviation\n- References: RS v14.0 and RTM v17.0 correctly stated\n- No placeholder content (TBD/TODO/FIXME)\n- Section numbering correct (1-12)\n- No other EIs have Pass/Fail contradictions"}

Task Outcome 'Pass' is now consistent with completed work. Post-execution commit a4582d5 confirmed in pipe-dream git log ('CR-087 post-execution: QMS CLI Quality, State Machine, and Workflow Enforcement').\n\nDEFICIENCY 2 RESOLVED - Frontmatter revision_summary updated from 'Initial draft' to 'Execution complete: 5 qms-cli improvements (create message, YAML-only prompts, consolidated state machine, auto-withdraw/auto-checkin, audit completeness). 416 tests passing. RS v14.0, RTM v17.0 EFFECTIVE.'
