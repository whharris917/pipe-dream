One deficiency found regarding the VR gate requirement.\n\nDEFICIENCY: EI-11 has VR column = \"Yes\" but no VR has been attached. Per SOP-002 Section 7.3 item 6: \"All execution items flagged with 'Yes' in the VR column have an attached VR that is checked in and ready for review.\" Per SOP-004 Section 9C.3: during execution, the VR ID should replace \"Yes\" in the VR column.\n\nI understand the bootstrap paradox — the VR authoring system did not exist until this CR created it, so a VR could not have been created during execution using the mechanism being built. However, the SOP requirement is unambiguous, and the document as written does not conform.\n\nRESOLUTION OPTIONS (choose one):\n1. **Create a VR now.** The interaction system is now operational (TEMPLATE-VR v2.0 EFFECTIVE, all code merged). Create a VR for EI-11 using `qms interact`, record the evidence retroactively, and update the VR column with the VR ID. This retroactive approach is acceptable if the evidence (qualified commit 7e708fc, 611 tests) is referenced rather than re-executed.\n2. **Attach a VAR.** If a VR cannot be created for procedural reasons, create a Type 2 VAR documenting the bootstrap paradox and the alternative evidence (qualified commit). Update the EI table to reference the VAR.\n3. **Remove the VR flag.** If integration verification was not actually required for EI-11 (the testing EI), change VR from \"Yes\" to blank. However, this modifies pre-approved content (the VR column \"Yes\" was a static planning field), which would itself require a VAR.\n\nOption 1 is the cleanest path — it exercises the system CR-091 built and produces the evidence artifact the SOP requires.\n\nALL OTHER POST-REVIEW ITEMS VERIFIED AND COMPLIANT:\n\nEXECUTION ITEMS:\n- All 19 EIs verified: each has Task Description, Execution Summary, Task Outcome (all Pass), and Performed By with date\n- No Fail outcomes, therefore no VARs required for failed tasks\n- EI-1 pre-execution baseline: commit 711c2e0 (recorded)\n- EI-19 post-execution baseline: commit f0533e8 (recorded)\n\nEXECUTION COMMENTS (lines 461-464):\n- Comment 1: Documents two compiler bugs found during EI-11 testing (loop expansion threshold, multi-line @template comment stripping). Both fixed and covered by tests.\n- Comment 2: Documents SOP-004 section numbering fix requested during QA review (EI-16/18).\nBoth comments properly attributed with performer and date.\n\nEXECUTION SUMMARY (lines 487-497):\n- Covers code (5 new modules, 5 modified, ~4500 lines, merge commit c83dda0)\n- Covers tests (182 new tests, 611 total, qualified commit 7e708fc, two bugs fixed)\n- Covers SDLC documents (RS v16.0, RTM v20.0, both EFFECTIVE)\n- Covers controlled documents (SOP-004 v9.0, TEMPLATE-VR v2.0, both EFFECTIVE)\n- Notes deviation: EI-16 description says \"Section 12\" but actual section numbered 11 (corrected during review)\n\nCONTROLLED DOCUMENTS STATUS (per SOP-002 Section 7.3 item 3):\n- SDLC-QMS-RS: v16.0 EFFECTIVE (confirmed)\n- SDLC-QMS-RTM: v20.0 EFFECTIVE (confirmed)\n- SOP-004: v9.0 EFFECTIVE (confirmed)\n- TEMPLATE-VR: v2.0 EFFECTIVE (confirmed)\n\nSDLC PREREQUISITES (per SOP-002 Section 7.3 item 5):\n- RS EFFECTIVE (v16.0) and RTM EFFECTIVE (v20.0) — met\n\nPLACEHOLDER CONTENT: None found.\nTYPOS/ERRORS: None found beyond the noted VR column issue.\nFORMATTING: Consistent throughout."}
