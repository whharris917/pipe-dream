No TU reviewers required - changes are documentation fixes and QMS infrastructure code, not domain-specific application code. Recommend approval."}

Only 1 of 8 planned changes was implemented (CLAUDE.md SOP-002 reference removal - verified correct). The remaining 7 changes were blocked: 5 by Edit tool errors (qa.md, bu.md, qms.py x3) and 2 by QMS workflow requirements (SOP-001, SOP-002). The CR title promises 'QA permissions and archive bug' but neither was delivered. Recommend one of: (1) Revert to IN_EXECUTION to retry blocked changes with alternative approaches, (2) Revise CR scope to document only the completed change and create follow-up CRs for remaining items, or (3) If Edit tool issues are environmental and cannot be resolved, document this in CR and proceed with partial completion - but CR title/scope must be updated to reflect actual deliverables."}
