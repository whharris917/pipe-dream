Recommend for approval.\n\nFRONTMATTER:\n- title: \"Attachment Auto-Close + VR Template/Compiler Refinements\" — present, non-empty\n- revision_summary: \"Initial draft\" — acceptable for v0.1 per SOP-002 Section 8\n\nSTRUCTURE (SOP-002 Section 6):\nAll 12 required sections present: Purpose, Scope, Current State, Proposed State, Change Description, Justification, Impact Assessment, Testing Summary, Implementation Plan, Execution, Execution Summary, References.\n\nPLACEHOLDER CONTENT:\nNo TBD, TODO, FIXME, or XXX in pre-approved content (Sections 1-9, 12). Editable fields in Sections 10-11 contain expected execution-phase templates per SOP-004 Section 4.2.\n\nTRACEABILITY:\n- SOP-004 Section 9C.2 claim verified: \"closed when parent document closes\" confirmed in SOP-004 VR Lifecycle workflow\n- References SOP-001, SOP-002, SOP-004, SOP-005, SOP-006, CR-094 — all valid\n- Parent Document: None (independent improvement) — appropriate\n\nTECHNICAL ASSESSMENT:\nTheme A (Attachment Lifecycle): Sound generic approach. attachment flag provides extensibility. Terminal state checkout guard closes a gap against SOP-001 Section 8.3. Cascade close implements SOP-004 9C.2 mandate. Auto-compile before cascade close prevents data loss for checked-out interactive documents.\n\nTheme B (Template/Compiler): Template v5 changes well-itemized. Removing Signature/References sections aligns with SOP-004 9C.2 (no independent approval cycle). Auto-metadata, block rendering, attribution placement, and step subsection numbering are clearly specified.\n\nBUNDLING: Both themes affect qms-cli. Logical grouping — Theme A implements lifecycle integration, Theme B improves output quality for the same document type. Reasonable scope.\n\nIMPACT ASSESSMENT: Files Affected, Documents Affected, Development Controls, and Qualified State Continuity all complete. Six new requirements identified for SDLC-QMS-RS/RTM.\n\nEI TABLE: 12 items. EI-1 and EI-12 satisfy SOP-004 Section 5 pre/post-execution commit requirements. EI-6 flagged for VR (integration verification). Structure aligns with implementation plan phases.\n\nFORMATTING: No typos, consistent section numbering, consistent table formatting, consistent horizontal rules."}

Request updates.\n\nCRITICAL DEFICIENCY: Execution content not checked into the document.\n\nThe CR was routed for post-review without execution results being recorded in the controlled document. The audit trail confirms no CHECKOUT or CHECKIN event occurred between RELEASE (2026-02-22T01:14:07) and ROUTE POST_REVIEW (2026-02-22T03:57:33). Both the QMS read command and direct file inspection of CR-095-draft.md confirm the following:\n\nSECTION 10 (Execution): All 12 execution items contain placeholder markers:\n- Execution Summary column: \"[SUMMARY]\" in all 12 rows (EI-1 through EI-12)\n- Task Outcome column: \"[Pass/Fail]\" in all 12 rows\n- Performed By - Date column: \"[PERFORMER] - [DATE]\" in all 12 rows\n\nSECTION 10 (Execution Comments): Contains placeholder \"[COMMENT]\" / \"[PERFORMER] - [DATE]\"\n\nSECTION 11 (Execution Summary): Contains placeholder \"[EXECUTION_SUMMARY]\"\n\nSOP-002 SECTION 7.3 VERIFICATION FAILURES:\n\n1. Execution Complete (7.3.1): FAILED — No execution items have Task Outcome recorded. All 12 EIs show \"[Pass/Fail]\".\n\n2. Evidence Documented (7.3.4): FAILED — No completion evidence recorded in Execution Summary column. All EIs show \"[SUMMARY]\".\n\n3. VRs Complete (7.3.6): FAILED — EI-6 is flagged \"Yes\" in the VR column but no CR-095-VR document exists in the QMS (confirmed via file system search).\n\n4. Execution Summary (Section 11): FAILED — Contains only the placeholder \"[EXECUTION_SUMMARY]\" with no narrative of execution results.\n\nREQUIRED CORRECTIVE ACTION:\n\nThe initiator must:\n1. Check out CR-095\n2. Fill in all execution results in Section 10 (Execution Summary, Task Outcome, Performed By - Date for all 12 EIs)\n3. Fill in Execution Comments with relevant observations\n4. Write the Section 11 Execution Summary narrative\n5. Create and complete the VR for EI-6 (integration verification)\n6. Check in the completed document\n7. Re-route for post-review\n\nNOTE: The execution summary provided in the routing message (describing EI-1 through EI-12 completion, 673 tests passing, commit hashes, etc.) was not recorded in the controlled document. The routing message is not a substitute for document content — execution evidence must be in the CR itself per SOP-002 Section 6.10."}
