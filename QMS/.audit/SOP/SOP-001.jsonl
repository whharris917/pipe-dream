PERMISSION INCONSISTENCY: Section 4.2 Permission Matrix shows only QA has 'fix' permission, but Section 13 CLI Reference states 'QA/lead only'. These must align. Recommend updating Section 4.2 to show lead also has fix permission, or updating Section 13 to show QA only.\n\n2. FRONTMATTER SCHEMA MISMATCH: Section 12 schema shows 'reviewers:' and 'approvers:' but actual frontmatter in this document uses 'assignees:' for both review_history and approval_history. Schema must match implementation.\n\n3. SCHEMA MISSING TYPE FIELD: Section 12 schema shows 'type:' only in approval_history, but actual implementation includes 'type: REVIEW' in review_history entries. Document the type field in review_history schema.\n\n4. SCHEMA MISSING OUTCOME FIELD: The review workflow documents --recommend and --request-updates outcomes, but the frontmatter schema does not show where/how this outcome is recorded. Add the outcome field to the review assignee schema.\n\nStrengths noted: State diagrams are excellent, version numbering is clear, workflow documentation is thorough. After addressing these schema alignment issues, document will be ready for approval."}

All CLI examples throughout the document have been updated to use the required --user flag. Verified: (1) Section 8 Workflows - all 9 CLI examples updated; (2) Section 10 Check-Out/Check-In - all 4 CLI examples updated; (3) Section 13 CLI Reference - introductory sentence added and all 20 commands now show --user {USER} syntax; (4) Section 15 Revision History - v2.1 entry correctly documents the change. One observation: the assign command uses --user twice (once for calling user, once for target users), which is consistent but potentially confusing. This is a design choice and does not block approval. Document is internally consistent and ready for approval."}

This minor documentation update correctly addresses the confusion identified in the v2.1 review regarding the dual use of --user in the assign command.
