Recommend updating Section 4.2 to show lead also has fix permission, or updating Section 13 to show QA only.\n\n2.

Schema must match implementation.\n\n3. SCHEMA MISSING TYPE FIELD: Section 12 schema shows 'type:' only in approval_history, but actual implementation includes 'type: REVIEW' in review_history entries. Document the type field in review_history schema.\n\n4. SCHEMA MISSING OUTCOME FIELD: The review workflow documents --recommend and --request-updates outcomes, but the frontmatter schema does not show where/how this outcome is recorded. Add the outcome field to the review assignee schema.\n\nStrengths noted: State diagrams are excellent, version numbering is clear, workflow documentation is thorough. After addressing these schema alignment issues, document will be ready for approval."}

Provides CLI commands for accessing this metadata (qms status, qms history). Includes rationale explaining the single source of truth principle. CORRECT.\n\n3. REMOVED REVISION HISTORY TABLE (Section 15): The revision history table has been removed.
