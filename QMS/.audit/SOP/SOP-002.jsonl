The schema specifies:\n   - SOP-001 schema: review_history[].reviewers[].{user, status, date, comments}\n   - Draft SOP-002: review_history[].assignees[].{user, status, date, comments}\n   \n2. **Missing 'type' field in review_history:** SOP-001 shows this is optional for review but the document uses 'type: REVIEW' which is acceptable.\n\n### Workflow Compliance\n\nThe document is correctly in IN_REVIEW status, which is valid per SOP-001 Section 9.1 state machine for non-executable documents.\n\n### Critical Document Identity Issue\n\n**REJECTED: Document ID Conflict**\n\nThis draft is titled 'Change Control' and assigned doc_id SOP-002. However:\n\n- An existing SOP-002 titled 'Quality Assurance Requirements' exists at SDLC/SOPs/SOP-002.md\n- That document is referenced by SOP-003 Section 2 (Prerequisites) and CLAUDE.md\n- SOP-001 Section 7.1 establishes the SOP hierarchy and lists SOP-002 as 'Quality Assurance Requirements'\n\nCreating a second SOP-002 with different content would cause:\n1. Document ID collision\n2. Broken references throughout the QMS\n3. Ambiguity about which SOP-002 is authoritative\n\n### Content Review\n\nThe content itself is technically sound and well-structured. The Change Control procedures are clearly documented and properly reference SOP-001 workflows. However, this content should be assigned a new document ID (e.g., SOP-010 or higher) to avoid collision with the existing SOP-002.\n\n### Recommendation\n\n1. Assign a new document ID (suggest SOP-010: Change Control)\n2. Update the title in frontmatter to match\n3. Fix the review_history schema to use 'reviewers' instead of 'assignees'\n4. Re-route for review after corrections"}
