Recommend for approval.\n\nFRONTMATTER:\n- title: \"Switch PTY Manager to tmux Control Mode for Terminal Scrollback\" -- present and non-empty.\n- revision_summary: \"Initial draft\" -- acceptable for v0.1 of a self-authorizing executable document per SOP-001 Section 5.1.\n\nSOP-004 SECTION 9A.3 REQUIRED CONTENT -- all sections present and complete:\n1. Variance Identification: Parent=CR-081 (verified IN_EXECUTION at v1.1), Affected Item=EI-4/Scope expansion, Type=Type 1.\n2. Detailed Description: Clearly states expected vs. actual. Documents four failed workaround approaches (DECSTBM stripping, extended scroll regions, SU-to-newline conversion, resize suppression) with technical rationale for each failure.\n3. Root Cause: \"Scope Error\" -- tmux normal attach performs lossy viewport rendering that destroys scrollback semantics. Control mode bypasses rendering entirely.\n4. Variance Type: \"Scope Error\" correctly selected from SOP-004 enumerated list with sound justification.\n5. Impact Assessment with Scope Handoff per 9A.5: (a) Accomplished in parent: EI-1 through EI-3 passing with specific evidence cited. (b) VAR absorbs: EI-4 failure plus scope expansion for control mode implementation (pty_manager rewrite, useHubConnection simplification, new unit tests). (c) Explicit confirmation: \"No scope items are lost.\"\n6. Proposed Resolution: Technically detailed -- explains control mode protocol, lists per-file changes at function level, identifies additions, modifications, and removals.\n7. Resolution EIs: Four EIs covering backend rewrite, frontend simplification, unit tests, and manual verification -- logical progression with complete coverage.\n\nTYPE 1 CLASSIFICATION: Correct per SOP-004 9A.2. Parent CR-081 EI-4 (manual verification) cannot pass without scrollback working. Full VAR closure is required before parent can close.\n\nPLACEHOLDER CHECK: No TBD, TODO, FIXME, or XXX in pre-approved content. Executable block editable fields ([EXECUTION_SUMMARY], [Pass/Fail], [PERFORMER], [DATE]) are correctly blank per SOP-004 Section 4.1.\n\nFORMATTING/ERRORS: No typos found. Section numbering sequential (1-9). Markdown tables well-formed. Code blocks properly fenced. Consistent formatting throughout.\n\nREFERENCES: SOP-004, CR-081, CR-080, SOP-002 -- all relevant and valid."}
