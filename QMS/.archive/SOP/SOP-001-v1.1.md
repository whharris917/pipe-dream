    comments: 'Review of SOP-001 v1.1 identifies the following items requiring correction
      before approval:


      1. PERMISSION INCONSISTENCY: Section 4.2 Permission Matrix shows only QA has
      ''fix'' permission, but Section 13 CLI Reference states ''QA/lead only''. These
      must align. Recommend updating Section 4.2 to show lead also has fix permission,
      or updating Section 13 to show QA only.


      2. FRONTMATTER SCHEMA MISMATCH: Section 12 schema shows ''reviewers:'' and ''approvers:''
      but actual frontmatter in this document uses ''assignees:'' for both review_history
      and approval_history. Schema must match implementation.


      3. SCHEMA MISSING TYPE FIELD: Section 12 schema shows ''type:'' only in approval_history,
      but actual implementation includes ''type: REVIEW'' in review_history entries.
      Document the type field in review_history schema.


      4. SCHEMA MISSING OUTCOME FIELD: The review workflow documents --recommend and
      --request-updates outcomes, but the frontmatter schema does not show where/how
      this outcome is recorded. Add the outcome field to the review assignee schema.


      Strengths noted: State diagrams are excellent, version numbering is clear, workflow
      documentation is thorough. After addressing these schema alignment issues, document
      will be ready for approval.'

### 5.2 Document Naming Convention

| Document Type | Format | Example |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Standard Operating Procedure | SOP-NNN | SOP-001 |
| Change Record | CR-NNN | CR-005 |
| Investigation | INV-NNN | INV-001 |
| CAPA (child of INV) | INV-NNN-CAPA-NNN | INV-001-CAPA-002 |
| Test Protocol (child of CR) | CR-NNN-TP | CR-005-TP |
| Exception Report (child of TP) | CR-NNN-TP-ER-NNN | CR-005-TP-ER-001 |

### 5.3 File Naming

| State | Filename |
|-------|----------|
| Effective version | `{DOC_ID}.md` |
| Draft version | `{DOC_ID}-draft.md` |
| Archived version | `{DOC_ID}-v{N.X}.md` |

**Examples:**
- `SOP-001.md` — Effective version of SOP-001
- `SOP-001-draft.md` — Draft version being revised
- `.archive/SOP/SOP-001-v1.0.md` — Archived version 1.0

---

## 6. Version Control

### 6.1 Version Numbering

Versions follow the format `N.X` where:

- **N** = Approval number (major version)
- **X** = Revision number within approval cycle (minor version)

| Version | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| v0.1 | Initial draft (never approved) |
| v0.2, v0.3... | Revisions during initial review cycle |
| v1.0 | First approval |
| v1.1, v1.2... | Revisions after re-opening v1.0 |
| v2.0 | Second approval |
| vN.0 | Nth approval |
| vN.X | Xth revision toward approval N+1 |

### 6.2 Version Transitions

| Action | Version Change |
|--------|----------------|
| Create new document | → v0.1 |
| Revise during review | v0.X → v0.(X+1) |
| First approval | v0.X → v1.0 |
| Re-open effective document | vN.0 → vN.1 |
| Subsequent approval | vN.X → v(N+1).0 |

### 6.3 Archive Management

When a document version is superseded:

1. The previous version is copied to `.archive/{TYPE}/`
2. The archive copy is renamed to include the version: `{DOC_ID}-v{N.X}.md`
3. The working directory retains only the current effective and/or draft versions

---

## 7. Document Status

### 7.1 Non-Executable Documents (SOP, RS, DS, CS, RTM, OQ)

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| DRAFT | Document is being created or revised |
| IN_REVIEW | Document is routed for review |
| REVIEWED | All assigned reviews are complete |
| IN_APPROVAL | Document is routed for approval |
| APPROVED | All assigned approvals are complete |
| EFFECTIVE | Document is approved and in force |
| SUPERSEDED | Document has been replaced by a newer version |

### 7.2 Executable Documents (CR, INV, CAPA, TP, ER)

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| DRAFT | Document is being created or revised |
| IN_PRE_REVIEW | Document is routed for pre-execution review |
| PRE_REVIEWED | All pre-reviews are complete |
| IN_PRE_APPROVAL | Document is routed for pre-execution approval |
| PRE_APPROVED | Document is approved for execution |
| IN_EXECUTION | Implementation/execution is in progress |
| IN_POST_REVIEW | Document is routed for post-execution review |
| POST_REVIEWED | All post-reviews are complete |
| IN_POST_APPROVAL | Document is routed for post-execution approval |
| POST_APPROVED | Execution verified and approved |
| CLOSED | Document is complete and closed |

---

## 8. Workflows

### 8.1 Review Workflow

Reviews must precede all approvals. Multiple review rounds are permitted.

**Initiating Review:**
```
qms route {DOC_ID} --review
qms route {DOC_ID} --pre-review     # Executable docs
qms route {DOC_ID} --post-review    # After execution
```

QA is automatically assigned when a document is routed. QA then assigns Technical Units as needed:
```
qms assign {DOC_ID} tu_ui tu_scene   # QA assigns additional reviewers
```

**Completing Review:**
```
qms review {DOC_ID} --recommend --comment "Looks good"
qms review {DOC_ID} --request-updates --comment "Changes needed"
```

Review outcomes:
- `--recommend`: Reviewer approves proceeding to approval stage
- `--request-updates`: Reviewer requires changes before approval

**Automatic Transition:** When all assigned reviewers complete their reviews, status transitions automatically:
- IN_REVIEW → REVIEWED
- IN_PRE_REVIEW → PRE_REVIEWED
- IN_POST_REVIEW → POST_REVIEWED

### 8.2 Approval Workflow

Approvals may only be initiated after review is complete AND all reviewers have `--recommend` outcome.

**Approval Gate:** The system blocks approval routing if any reviewer submitted `--request-updates`. The initiator must address the requested changes and route for another review round.

**Initiating Approval:**
```
qms route {DOC_ID} --approval
qms route {DOC_ID} --pre-approval    # Executable docs
qms route {DOC_ID} --post-approval   # After execution
```

The same Review Team (QA + assigned TUs) remains assigned for approval.

**Approving:**
```
qms approve {DOC_ID}
```

**Rejecting:**
```
qms reject {DOC_ID} --comment "Rejection rationale"
```

**Automatic Transitions:**
- All approvals complete: IN_APPROVAL → APPROVED, IN_PRE_APPROVAL → PRE_APPROVED, etc.
- Any rejection: Returns to previous REVIEWED state for revision

### 8.3 Rejection Handling

When any approver rejects a document:

| From Status | Transitions To | Required Action |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| IN_APPROVAL | REVIEWED | Revise, then re-route for review |
| IN_PRE_APPROVAL | PRE_REVIEWED | Revise, then re-route for pre-review |
| IN_POST_APPROVAL | POST_REVIEWED | Revise, then re-route for post-review |

The Responsible User must:
1. Address rejection comments
2. Check in the revised document
3. Route for another review cycle before re-routing for approval

### 8.4 Release Workflow (Executable Documents Only)

After pre-approval, executable documents must be manually released:

```
qms release {DOC_ID}
```

This transitions the document from PRE_APPROVED to IN_EXECUTION.

### 8.5 Revert Workflow (Executable Documents Only)

If problems are discovered after post-review, the document may revert to execution:

```
qms revert {DOC_ID} --reason "Reason for revert"
```

This transitions from POST_REVIEWED back to IN_EXECUTION.

### 8.6 Close Workflow (Executable Documents Only)

After post-approval, executable documents must be manually closed:

```
qms close {DOC_ID}
```

```

---

## 10. Check-Out / Check-In

### 10.1 Check-Out

To edit a document, a user must check it out:

```
qms checkout {DOC_ID}
```

Effects:
1. If an effective version exists, creates a new draft at version N.1
2. Document is copied to user's workspace
3. User becomes Responsible User
4. Document is locked; other users cannot edit

### 10.2 Check-In

To save changes back to the QMS:

```
qms checkin {DOC_ID}
```

Effects:
1. Document is copied from workspace to QMS working directory
2. Previous draft version (if any) is archived
3. Document remains checked out to user

### 10.3 Reading Documents

Any user may read documents without checking out:

```
qms read {DOC_ID}                    # Latest effective version
qms read {DOC_ID} --draft            # Current draft
qms read {DOC_ID} --version N.X      # Specific archived version
```

---

## 11. User Workspaces and Inboxes

### 11.1 Workspace

Each user has a workspace at `.claude/users/{username}/workspace/`

- Contains documents checked out by that user
- Only the workspace owner may edit documents within
- Documents must be checked in to be visible to others

### 11.2 Inbox

Each user has an inbox at `.claude/users/{username}/inbox/`

- Contains task files for assigned reviews and approvals
- Tasks are automatically created when documents are routed
- Tasks are removed when the user completes the action

**Task File Format:**
```yaml
---
task_id: task_001
task_type: REVIEW  # or APPROVAL
doc_id: CR-005
assigned_by: claude
assigned_date: 2026-01-02
due_date: null
---

Please review CR-005 for technical accuracy.
```

---

## 12. Frontmatter Schema

All controlled documents must include YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
doc_id: {DOC_ID}
title: {Document Title}
version: {N.X}
status: {STATUS}
document_type: {SOP|CR|INV|CAPA|TP|ER|RS|DS|CS|RTM|OQ}
executable: {true|false}

responsible_user: {username}
checked_out: {true|false}
checked_out_date: {YYYY-MM-DD|null}

effective_version: {N.X|null}
supersedes: {DOC_ID vN.X|null}

review_history:
  - round: 1
    type: {REVIEW|PRE_REVIEW|POST_REVIEW}
    date_initiated: {YYYY-MM-DD}
    assignees:
      - user: {username}
        status: {PENDING|COMPLETE}
        date: {YYYY-MM-DD|null}
        comments: "{comments}"
        outcome: {RECOMMEND|UPDATES_REQUIRED|null}
