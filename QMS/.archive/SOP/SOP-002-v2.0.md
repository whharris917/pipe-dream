# SOP-002: Change Control

---

## 1. Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure establishes the change control process for the Flow State project. It defines the requirements for initiating, documenting, reviewing, and approving changes within the Quality Management System.

---

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all changes within the Flow State project, including:

- Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
- Source code and configuration
- System architecture and design
- User interface and user experience
- Documentation

**All changes require a Change Record (CR).** No exceptions.

---

## 3. Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **CR** | Change Record - the controlled document authorizing a change |
| **TP** | Test Protocol - optional document detailing test procedures for a CR |
| **QA** | Quality Assurance Representative - mandatory reviewer and approver |
| **TU** | Technical Unit - domain expert assigned by QA to review technical changes |
| **Review Team** | QA plus any TUs assigned to a CR; this team remains consistent throughout the CR lifecycle |

---

## 4. Responsibilities

### 4.1 Change Initiator

The user initiating a change shall:

- Create a CR documenting the proposed change
- Provide all required content per Section 6
- Address reviewer comments
- Execute the change after pre-approval
- Document execution results for post-review

### 4.2 QA Representative

QA shall:

- Review all CRs for procedural compliance
- Determine which TUs (if any) must join the Review Team for each CR
- Determine if a Test Protocol (TP) is required
- Serve as mandatory member of the Review Team

### 4.3 Review Team

The Review Team (QA + assigned TUs) shall:

- Remain consistent throughout the CR lifecycle
- Participate in both pre-review and post-review
- Participate in both pre-approval and post-approval
- Verify the change is well-defined (pre) and correctly implemented (post)

---

## 5. CR Numbering

Change Records use sequential numbering:

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| CR-NNN | CR-001, CR-002, CR-003 |

Numbers are assigned in order of creation and are never reused.

---

## 6. CR Content Requirements

Every Change Record shall include:

### 6.1 Description

A clear description of what will be changed. Include:

- Current state (what exists now)
- Proposed state (what will exist after the change)
- Affected files, documents, or systems

### 6.2 Rationale

The reason for the change. Explain:

- Why the change is necessary
- What problem it solves or what improvement it provides

### 6.3 Testing Summary

A brief summary of what testing will be performed to verify the change. This need not be exhaustive; if QA determines comprehensive testing is required, a separate Test Protocol (TP) will be created.

Examples of testing summaries:
- "Manual verification of corrected frontmatter fields"
- "Unit tests for new function; integration test for workflow"
- "Visual inspection of UI changes across supported resolutions"

---

## 7. CR Workflow

Change Records follow the executable document workflow defined in SOP-001.

### 7.1 Review Team Assignment

When a CR is routed for pre-review, QA determines the Review Team composition:

- QA is always included
- TUs are assigned based on the technical domains affected by the change

This team remains assigned for all subsequent workflow stages.

### 7.2 Execution

After pre-approval, the change initiator:

1. Releases the CR for execution (`qms release`)
2. Implements the change as documented
3. Performs testing as described in the CR
4. Documents results in the CR

---

## 8. Document Traceability

All document revisions made under a Change Record must reference the CR ID in their `revision_summary` frontmatter field.

**Format:**
```yaml
revision_summary: "CR-XXX: Description of changes"
```

**Example:**
```yaml
revision_summary: "CR-004: Add traceability requirement for revision summaries"
```

This requirement:
- Establishes a clear link between document changes and their authorizing CRs
- Enables audit trails from any document revision back to the change control record
- Provides context (rationale, approvers, testing) for any historical revision

**Exceptions:**
- Initial document creation (v0.1) does not require a CR ID
- Documents created before this policy took effect are grandfathered

---

## 9. Test Protocol (TP)

If QA determines that a CR requires comprehensive testing, a Test Protocol shall be created as a child document of the CR.

| Parent | Child |
|--------|-------|
| CR-001 | CR-001-TP |
| CR-015 | CR-015-TP |

The TP follows its own executable workflow and must be closed before the parent CR can be closed.

---

## 10. Rollback

All changes are tracked in git. If a change must be reverted:

1. Create a new CR documenting the rollback
2. Reference the original CR being reverted
3. Execute the rollback using git commands
4. Follow the standard CR workflow
