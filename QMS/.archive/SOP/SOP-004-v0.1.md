# SOP-004: Document Execution

---

## 1. Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) governs the execution phase of all executable documents, including scope management, progress tracking, and evidence requirements.

---

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to the execution phase of:

- Change Records (CR)
- Investigations (INV)
- Test Protocols (TP)
- Exception Reports (ER)

Note: CAPAs are not standalone documents; they are execution items within INVs (see SOP-003).

---

## 3. Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Executable Document** | A document that authorizes implementation activities (CR, INV, TP, ER) |
| **Executable Block** | Section of an executable document where implementation work is recorded |
| **Execution Item (EI)** | Discrete unit of work within the executable block |
| **Evidence** | Documentation proving completion of an execution item |
| **Static Field** | A field in the executable block that is defined at document creation and is never editable (e.g., test step instructions) |
| **Editable Field** | A field in the executable block where execution work is recorded (e.g., execution details, evidence) |

---

## 4. The Executable Block

### 4.1 Structure

The executable block is located after pre-approved content (Purpose, Scope, Rationale, Plan) in an executable document.

The executable block contains:
- **Static fields:** Defined at document creation; never editable (e.g., test step instructions, execution item descriptions)
- **Editable fields:** Where execution work is recorded (e.g., status, evidence, notes)

### 4.2 Execution Item Table

Execution items are tracked in table format with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **EI** | Execution item identifier |
| **Description** | What the item accomplishes |
| **Status** | Current state: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE, BLOCKED |
| **Evidence** | Documentation of completion |
| **Follow-up** | Reference to related documents if applicable |

---

## 5. Document States During Execution

The executable block's editable fields change state as the document progresses:

| State | Executable Block (Editable Fields) | Pre-Approved Content |
|-------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **PRE_APPROVED** | Blank and locked | Locked |
| **IN_EXECUTION** | Editable | Locked |
| **POST_REVIEWED** | Editable (during review cycles) | Locked |
| **CLOSED** | Sealed | Sealed |

Note: The executable block structure (static fields) exists from document creation. Only the editable fields change state as described above.

---

## 6. Scope Integrity

Pre-approved scope items must be completed. This is a key lesson from INV-001.

### 6.1 Handling Obstacles

If obstacles arise during execution:

1. **Complete the item as planned**, OR
2. **Document an exception** via ER with rationale explaining why the item cannot be completed and how the situation will be resolved

### 6.2 Critical Principle

"Different execution mechanism" is NOT a scope exclusion. If scope was approved, it must be addressed.

Scope items cannot be silently dropped. If an item cannot be completed as originally planned, this must be formally documented with clear rationale and resolution path.

---

## 7. Progress Tracking

### 7.1 Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **PENDING** | Not yet started |
| **IN_PROGRESS** | Currently being worked on |
| **COMPLETE** | Finished; evidence documented |
| **BLOCKED** | Cannot proceed; requires resolution |

### 7.2 Updating Status

Execution item status should be updated as work progresses. BLOCKED items require explanation and resolution path documented in the Notes/Follow-up column.

---

## 8. Evidence Requirements

### 8.1 Completion Evidence

Each COMPLETE execution item requires documented evidence. Evidence demonstrates that the work was performed and the objective was achieved.

### 8.2 Evidence Types

Acceptable evidence includes:
- Commit hash (for code changes)
- Document ID (for document creation/updates)
- Test result (for testing activities)
- Screenshot (for visual verification)
- Other verifiable artifacts appropriate to the execution item

### 8.3 BLOCKED Items

BLOCKED items require:
- Explanation of the blocker
- Resolution path or follow-up reference

---

## 9. Exception Reports (ER)

Exception Reports are created when execution encounters unexpected issues that prevent completion of scope items.

### 9.1 ER Content

An Exception Report shall contain:
- **Issue description:** What happened and why
- **Impact assessment:** Effect on scope, timeline, or quality
- **Resolution or disposition:** How the issue was or will be resolved

### 9.2 When to Create an ER

Create an ER when:
- A scope item cannot be completed as planned
- Unexpected issues arise that affect execution
- Deviations from the approved plan are necessary

---

## 10. Post-Review Requirements

Per SOP-002 Section 7.3, a document may only be routed for post-review when:

1. **Execution Complete:** All execution items have status COMPLETE or are documented via ER
2. **Documentation Approved:** Any controlled documents modified under the executable document are EFFECTIVE
3. **Evidence Documented:** Completion evidence is recorded in the execution item table
