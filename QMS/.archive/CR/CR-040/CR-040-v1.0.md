# CR-040: SOP-006 and SOP-007 alignment corrections

## 1. Purpose

This CR removes specific user and agent identifiers from SOP-006 and SOP-007, replacing them with generic terminology. This aligns with the principles established in CR-037, CR-038, and CR-039: SOPs should use role-based and extensible terminology rather than specific user IDs.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

Following the SOP alignment effort initiated in CR-037 and continued through CR-038 and CR-039, an audit of SOP-004 through SOP-007 identified alignment issues in SOP-006 and SOP-007.

- **Parent Document:** CR-039 (continuation of SOP alignment effort)

### 2.2 Changes Summary

1. **SOP-006:** Replace specific agent reference ("TU-SIM") and user reference ("Lead") in example blocks with generic terminology
2. **SOP-007:** Remove specific user IDs (claude, qa, tu_ui, etc.) and replace "Lead" references with "project authority"

### 2.3 Files Affected

- `QMS/SOP/SOP-006.md` - Lines 168, 193 (example blocks)
- `QMS/SOP/SOP-007.md` - Lines 18, 19, 34, 35, 68, 92, 94, 173, 194, 203, 205

---

## 3. Current State

SOP-006 contains examples that reference specific agents ("TU-SIM") and users ("Lead").

SOP-007 contains multiple references to specific user IDs (claude, qa, tu_ui, tu_scene, tu_sketch, tu_sim, bu) and uses "Lead" to refer to the human project authority.

---

## 4. Proposed State

SOP-006 uses generic terminology in examples ("Reviewer agent", "Human reviewer").

SOP-007 uses generic, extensible terminology for agent roles and "project authority" for human oversight references.

---

## 5. Change Description

### 5.1 SOP-006 Changes

**Line 168 (Section 6.3.2 example):**

| Current | Proposed |
|---------|----------|
| `**Verified by:** TU-SIM` | `**Verified by:** Reviewer agent` |

**Line 193 (Section 6.4 example):**

| Current | Proposed |
|---------|----------|
| `**Verified by:** Lead (human visual inspection, 2026-01-15)` | `**Verified by:** Human reviewer (visual inspection, 2026-01-15)` |

### 5.2 SOP-007 Changes

**User ID removals:**

| Line | Current | Proposed |
|------|---------|----------|
| 18 | `The orchestrating agent (claude)` | `The orchestrating agent` |
| 19 | `All spawned subagents (qa, tu_ui, tu_scene, tu_sketch, tu_sim, bu)` | `All spawned subagents (Quality agents, Reviewer agents, or other subagents defined for the project)` |
| 34 | `The primary agent (claude) that spawns and coordinates subagents` | `The primary agent that spawns and coordinates subagents` |
| 35 | `A spawned agent with a specific role (qa, tu_ui, tu_scene, tu_sketch, tu_sim, bu)` | `A spawned agent assigned a specific role (e.g., Quality agent, Reviewer agent, or other project-defined roles)` |

**"Lead" to "project authority" replacements:**

| Line | Current | Proposed |
|------|---------|----------|
| 68 | `...to the orchestrator or Lead` | `...to the orchestrator or project authority` |
| 92 | `...unless explicitly directed by the Lead` | `...unless explicitly directed by the project authority` |
| 94 | `...the Lead will direct it explicitly` | `...the project authority will direct it explicitly` |
| 173 | `...without Lead authorization` | `...without project authority authorization` |
| 194 | `Escalated to the Lead for resolution` | `Escalated to the project authority for resolution` |
| 203 | `...if the Lead determines...` | `...if the project authority determines...` |
| 205 | `...at the Lead's discretion` | `...at the project authority's discretion` |

---

## 6. Justification

- **Consistency:** SOPs should not reference specific user identifiers per alignment principles established in CR-037/038/039
- **Extensibility:** Generic terminology ("Quality agents, Reviewer agents, or other subagents defined for the project") allows the framework to expand without SOP changes
- **Clarity:** Role-based terminology is clearer than user ID lists

|----------|-------------|-------------|
| SOP-006 | Modify | Replace specific identifiers in examples |
| SOP-007 | Modify | Remove user IDs, replace "Lead" with "project authority" |

### 7.3 Other Impacts

None. This CR corrects documentation only; no code changes required.

---

## 8. Testing Summary

- Verify SOP-006 does not contain "TU-SIM": `grep -c "TU-SIM" QMS/SOP/SOP-006.md` returns 0
- Verify SOP-007 does not contain user IDs: `grep -cE "\(claude\)|\(qa," QMS/SOP/SOP-007.md` returns 0
- Verify SOP-007 does not contain "Lead": `grep -c "Lead" QMS/SOP/SOP-007.md` returns 0
