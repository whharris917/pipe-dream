# CR-051: INV-010 CAPA Implementation: SDLC Prerequisite Gate Requirements

## 1. Purpose

This CR implements INV-010 CAPAs by adding explicit prerequisite gates requiring RS and RTM to be EFFECTIVE before a CR affecting an SDLC-governed system can be closed.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

INV-010 identified that CR-050 was closed before SDLC-QMS-RTM reached EFFECTIVE status. While technically compliant with current procedures, this revealed a gap: procedures do not explicitly require SDLC documents to be EFFECTIVE before CR closure.

- **Parent Document:** INV-010

### 2.2 Changes Summary

1. Add SOP-006 Section 7.4: CR Closure Prerequisite requiring RS/RTM EFFECTIVE
2. Update SOP-002 Section 7.3 to reference SOP-006 prerequisites
3. Update TEMPLATE-CR with explicit SDLC document approval execution items

### 2.3 Files Affected

- `QMS/SOP/SOP-006.md` - Add Section 7.4 CR Closure Prerequisite
- `QMS/SOP/SOP-002.md` - Add SDLC prerequisite to Section 7.3
- `QMS/TEMPLATE/TEMPLATE-CR.md` - Add RTM approval execution item

---

## 3. Current State

1. SOP-006 defines qualified state but does not tie it to CR closure
2. SOP-002 Section 7.3 requires "Documentation Approved" but is not specific about SDLC documents
3. TEMPLATE-CR mentions RS/RTM in comments but has no explicit execution item for RTM approval

---

## 4. Proposed State

1. SOP-006 Section 7.4 explicitly requires RS and RTM to be EFFECTIVE before any CR affecting that system can be closed
2. SOP-002 Section 7.3 references SOP-006 SDLC prerequisites for CRs affecting SDLC-governed systems
3. TEMPLATE-CR includes explicit execution item: "Verify RS and RTM are EFFECTIVE"

---

## 5. Change Description

### 5.1 SOP-006: Add Section 7.4 CR Closure Prerequisite

Add new section after Section 7.3:

**New Section 7.4 CR Closure Prerequisite:**

> For any CR that modifies an SDLC-governed system:
>
> 1. The system's RS must be EFFECTIVE before the CR can be routed for post-review
> 2. The system's RTM must be EFFECTIVE before the CR can be routed for post-review
>
> **Rationale:** A CR claiming to qualify a system is not complete until the qualification evidence (RTM) is formally approved. Closing a CR before RTM approval creates a window where the system is claimed qualified but lacks approved verification evidence.
>
> This requirement applies regardless of whether the CR modifies RS/RTM content. If the CR touches code in an SDLC-governed system, the RTM must reflect the qualified state.

### 5.2 SOP-002: Update Section 7.3

Add item 5 to the post-review conditions list:

> 5. **SDLC Prerequisites Met:** For CRs affecting SDLC-governed systems per SOP-006, the system's RS and RTM must be EFFECTIVE (see SOP-006 Section 7.4)

Update QA Post-Review Verification to include:

> - For code CRs: RS and RTM for affected systems are EFFECTIVE per SOP-006 Section 7.4

### 5.3 TEMPLATE-CR: Add RTM Approval Execution Item

Update Phase 9.5 (RTM Update) to explicitly include approval verification:

**Before:**
```markdown
### 9.5 Phase 5: RTM Update

1. Checkout SDLC-{{NS}}-RTM in production QMS
2. Add verification evidence referencing CI-verified commit
3. Checkin RTM, route for review and approval
```

**After:**
```markdown
### 9.5 Phase 5: RTM Update and Approval

1. Checkout SDLC-{{NS}}-RTM in production QMS
2. Add verification evidence referencing CI-verified commit
3. Checkin RTM, route for review and approval
4. **Verify RTM reaches EFFECTIVE status before proceeding to Phase 6**
```

Update Phase 9.6 with prerequisite note:

**Before:**
```markdown
### 9.6 Phase 6: Merge and Submodule Update

1. Once RS and RTM are EFFECTIVE, create PR to merge dev branch to main
```

**After:**
```markdown
### 9.6 Phase 6: Merge and Submodule Update

**Prerequisite:** RS and RTM must both be EFFECTIVE before proceeding (per SOP-006 Section 7.4).

1. Verify RS is EFFECTIVE (document status check)
2. Verify RTM is EFFECTIVE (document status check)
3. Create PR to merge dev branch to main
```

---

## 6. Justification

- **INV-010 CAPA compliance:** Implements all three preventive CAPAs
- **Process clarity:** Removes ambiguity about when SDLC documents must be approved
- **Qualification integrity:** Ensures a system cannot be claimed "qualified" before RTM is EFFECTIVE
- **Recursive improvement:** The QMS governing SDLC governance now has explicit gates

Impact of not making this change:
- Future CRs may close before RTM is approved
- "Qualified" claims may precede formal qualification evidence
