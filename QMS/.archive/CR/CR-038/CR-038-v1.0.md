# CR-038: SOP-001 and SOP-002 alignment corrections

## 1. Purpose

This CR corrects residual alignment issues in SOP-001 and SOP-002 identified during the CR-037 audit process. SOP-001 Section 13.6 contains an incorrect permission description, and SOP-002 contains outdated terminology and invalid CAPA references.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

During CR-037 execution, additional issues were identified in SOP-001 Section 13.6 (outside CR-037 scope). A subsequent audit of SOP-002 revealed terminology inconsistencies with the updated SOP-001 and references to CAPA as a document type (invalid per REQ-DOC-001).

- **Parent Document:** CR-037 (findings during execution)

### 2.2 Changes Summary

1. **SOP-001 Section 4.1:** Remove implementation-specific note referencing agent definition files
2. **SOP-001 Section 13.6:** Correct fix command description from "(QA/lead only)" to "(Administrator group only)"
3. **SOP-002 Section 3:** Align terminology with SOP-001 group names (Quality, Reviewer)
4. **SOP-002 Section 6.2:** Remove CAPA reference
5. **SOP-002 Section 6.12:** Remove CAPA reference

### 2.3 Files Affected

- `QMS/SOP/SOP-001.md` - Sections 4.1, 13.6
- `QMS/SOP/SOP-002.md` - Sections 3, 6.2, 6.12

---

## 3. Current State

SOP-001 Section 4.1 contains a note referencing agent definition files and SDLC-QMS-RS REQ-USER-002. This implementation-specific detail is inappropriate for a governance SOP.

SOP-001 Section 13.6 states the fix command is available to "(QA/lead only)", contradicting Section 4.2 which specifies only Administrator group can fix.

SOP-002 Section 3 defines "QA" and "TU" without reference to SOP-001 group names (Quality, Reviewer).

SOP-002 Sections 6.2 and 6.12 reference "CAPA" as a parent document type, but CAPAs are execution items within Investigations, not standalone documents.

---

## 4. Proposed State

SOP-001 Section 4.1 defines user groups without implementation-specific references. The mechanism for user-to-group assignment is an implementation detail outside SOP scope.

SOP-001 Section 13.6 accurately states the fix command is available to "(Administrator group only)", consistent with Section 4.2.

SOP-002 Section 3 definitions clarify the relationship between role names (QA, TU) and SOP-001 group names (Quality, Reviewer).

SOP-002 Sections 6.2 and 6.12 do not reference CAPA as a document type.

---

## 5. Change Description

### 5.1 SOP-001 Section 4.1

**Remove note:**
```
Note: Specific user-to-group assignments are managed via agent definition files (`.claude/agents/{user}.md`) per SDLC-QMS-RS REQ-USER-002.
```

SOPs are governance documents that define policy and process. Implementation details (how users are assigned to groups) are outside SOP scope, similar to how internal CLI code details are outside SOP scope.

### 5.2 SOP-001 Section 13.6

**Current (Line 738):**
```
| `python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} fix {DOC_ID}` | Administrative fix for EFFECTIVE docs (QA/lead only) |
```

**Proposed:**
```
| `python qms-cli/qms.py --user {USER} fix {DOC_ID}` | Administrative fix for EFFECTIVE docs (Administrator group only) |
```

### 5.3 SOP-002 Section 3 Definitions

**Current:**
```
| **QA** | Quality Assurance Representative - mandatory reviewer and approver |
| **TU** | Technical Unit - domain expert assigned by QA to review technical changes |
```

**Proposed:**
```
| **QA** | Quality Assurance Representative - member of Quality group per SOP-001; mandatory reviewer and approver |
| **TU** | Technical Unit - member of Reviewer group per SOP-001; domain expert assigned by QA to review technical changes |
```

### 5.4 SOP-002 Section 6.2 Scope

**Current:**
```
- **Context:** Reference to parent document (INV, CAPA) if applicable, or origin of the change
```

**Proposed:**
```
- **Context:** Reference to parent document (INV) if applicable, or origin of the change
```

### 5.5 SOP-002 Section 6.12 References

**Current:**
```
- Parent documents (INV, CAPA if applicable)
```

**Proposed:**
```
- Parent documents (INV if applicable)
```

---

## 6. Justification

- **Consistency:** SOP-001 Section 13.6 must match Section 4.2 permission matrix
- **Terminology alignment:** SOP-002 should reference SOP-001 group names for clarity
- **Document type accuracy:** CAPA is not a document type per REQ-DOC-001; referencing it as a parent document type is incorrect

---

## 7. Impact Assessment

### 7.1 Files Affected

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `QMS/SOP/SOP-001.md` | Modify | Sections 4.1 (remove note), 13.6 (fix command) |
| `QMS/SOP/SOP-002.md` | Modify | Sections 3, 6.2, 6.12 |

### 7.2 Documents Affected

| Document | Change Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| SOP-001 | Modify | Sections 4.1, 13.6 |
| SOP-002 | Modify | Sections 3, 6.2, 6.12 |

### 7.3 Other Impacts

None. This CR corrects documentation only; no code changes required.

---

## 8. Testing Summary

- Verify SOP-001 Section 13.6 says "(Administrator group only)": `grep "fix.*Administrator" QMS/SOP/SOP-001.md`
- Verify SOP-002 does not reference CAPA: `grep -c "CAPA" QMS/SOP/SOP-002.md` returns 0
- Verify SOP-002 Section 3 references SOP-001 groups: `grep "Quality group\|Reviewer group" QMS/SOP/SOP-002.md`
