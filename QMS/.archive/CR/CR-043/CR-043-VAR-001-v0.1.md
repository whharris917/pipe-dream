# CR-043-VAR-001: Add Claude Code Authentication and Python Dev Environment Support

## 1. Variance Identification

| Parent Document | Failed Item | VAR Type |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| CR-043 | Scope Definition (Sections 2, 5) | Type 1 |

## 2. Detailed Description

During pre-execution review of CR-043, two critical gaps were identified in the container infrastructure design:

1. **Claude Code Authentication**: The container has no mechanism to authenticate with Anthropic's API. Claude Code stores credentials in `~/.claude/.credentials.json` on the host, but this file is not mounted into the container. Without authentication, Claude Code cannot function.

2. **Python Development Environment**: The container is intended to support code development and testing, but lacks:
   - The `python3-venv` package for creating virtual environments
   - Documentation of the workflow for setting up dev environments in `/projects/`

**Expected:** Container can run Claude Code with proper authentication and support Python development workflows.

**Actual:** Original scope omitted credentials mount and Python venv tooling.

---

## 3. Root Cause

The original CR scope focused on QMS isolation and MCP connectivity but did not account for:
- Claude Code's authentication requirements (credentials file location)
- The practical needs of Python development within the container

These requirements were identified during architectural discussion after pre-approval but before execution began.

## 4. Variance Type

Scope Error: Plan/scope was written or designed incorrectly

## 5. Impact Assessment

**Impact on CR-043 Objectives:**
- Without credentials mount: Claude Code cannot authenticate, rendering the container non-functional for its intended purpose
- Without Python venv support: Container cannot support code development and testing workflows

**Severity:** Critical - affects core functionality

**Scope of Change:**
- Dockerfile: Add `python3-venv` package
- docker-compose.yml: Add credentials volume mount
- Filesystem structure: Document credentials and venv locations
- Testing: Add verification of authentication and venv creation
- EI table: Add two new execution items

---

## 6. Proposed Resolution

Expand CR-043 scope to include:

1. **Credentials Mount** (docker-compose.yml):
   ```yaml
   - ~/.claude/.credentials.json:/.claude/.credentials.json:ro
   ```

2. **Python venv Support** (Dockerfile):
   ```dockerfile
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
       ... \
       python3-venv \
       && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
   ```

3. **Updated Filesystem Structure:**
   ```
   /.claude/
   │   └── .credentials.json    # Auth credentials (mounted at runtime)
   /projects/
   │   └── {repo}/
   │       └── .venv/           # Virtual environment for dev/test
   ```

4. **Additional Tests:**
   - Verify credentials mount enables Claude Code authentication
   - Verify container can create venv and pip install in /projects/

5. **Additional EIs:**
   - EI-11: Test Claude Code authentication via mounted credentials
   - EI-12: Test Python venv creation and pip install in /projects/
   - Renumber existing EI-11/12 to EI-13/14
