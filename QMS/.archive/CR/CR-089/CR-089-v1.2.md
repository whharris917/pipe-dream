# CR-089: Verification Record (VR) Document Type

## 1. Purpose

Introduce Verification Records (VR) as a new QMS document type for structured behavioral testing. VRs provide a pre-approved evidence form for unscripted integration verification, replacing mandate-based language scattered across SOPs and templates with a concrete, auditable document.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

Session-2026-02-16-004 identified a gap: integration verification requirements (CR-084) had no structured form, producing a "mandate escalation cycle" where prose mandates could be technically satisfied without demonstrating behavioral correctness. The CR-088 health check deficiency exemplified this — a structural check passed while the actual behavior was broken.

- **Parent Document:** None (design-driven improvement from Session-2026-02-16-004)

### 2.2 Changes Summary

Add VR as a new executable child document type. VRs are born IN_EXECUTION (template is the pre-approval), follow standard post-execution workflow (post-review, post-approval, closure), and serve as the primary mechanism for unscripted behavioral verification. Supporting changes update SOPs, templates, and SDLC documents to reference VRs.

### 2.3 Files Affected

**QMS CLI (qms-cli submodule):**
- `qms-cli/qms_schema.py` — Add VR to type sets and ID patterns
- `qms-cli/qms_config.py` — Add VR to document type registry
- `qms-cli/qms_paths.py` — Add VR type detection and path resolution; fix deep nesting bug
- `qms-cli/commands/create.py` — Add VR parent validation, ID generation, initial state override
- `qms-cli/seed/templates/TEMPLATE-VR.md` — Seed template for `qms init`
- `qms-cli/tests/qualification/test_document_types.py` — VR qualification tests
- `qms-cli/tests/conftest.py` — Add VR directories to test fixture

**QMS Controlled Documents:**
- `QMS/TEMPLATE/TEMPLATE-VR.md` — New controlled template
- `QMS/TEMPLATE/TEMPLATE-CR.md` — Add VR column to EI table
- `QMS/TEMPLATE/TEMPLATE-VAR.md` — Add VR column to EI table
- `QMS/TEMPLATE/TEMPLATE-ADD.md` — Add VR column to EI table
- `QMS/SOP/SOP-001.md` — Add VR to definitions and naming conventions
- `QMS/SOP/SOP-002.md` — Simplify Section 6.8, add VR post-review gate
- `QMS/SOP/SOP-004.md` — Add VR to scope, EI table column, new Section 9C, post-review gate
- `QMS/SOP/SOP-006.md` — Add VR as third verification type
- `QMS/SDLC-QMS/SDLC-QMS-RS.md` — Add VR requirements
- `QMS/SDLC-QMS/SDLC-QMS-RTM.md` — Add VR test entries and qualified baseline

---

## 3. Current State

The QMS supports seven document types for executable workflows: CR, INV, TP, ER, VAR, ADD, and TEMPLATE. Integration verification is mandated by SOP-002 Section 6.8 as prose requirements, with no structured form for recording behavioral observations. The RTM supports two verification types: Unit Test and Qualitative Proof.

---

## 4. Proposed State

The QMS supports VR as an eighth executable document type. VRs are lightweight child documents of CR, VAR, or ADD, created during parent execution. They are born IN_EXECUTION at v1.0 (the approved TEMPLATE-VR serves as pre-approval authority) and follow standard post-execution workflow. The RTM supports three verification types: Unit Test, Qualitative Proof, and Verification Record. EI tables in CR, VAR, and ADD templates include a VR column indicating which execution items require behavioral verification.

---

## 5. Change Description

### 5.1 VR Lifecycle

VR is an executable document with a unique creation behavior: it is born directly at IN_EXECUTION (v1.0) with execution_phase set to post_release. This skips the DRAFT through PRE_APPROVED phases entirely — the approved TEMPLATE-VR serves as the pre-approval authority (batch record model from GMP).

From IN_EXECUTION onward, VR follows the standard executable workflow: post-review, post-approval, and closure. No changes to `workflow.py` are required.

**VR workflow:**
```
create (IN_EXECUTION v1.0, checked out) → fill in → checkin
→ route post-review → QA review → route post-approval → QA approve → close
```

### 5.2 VR as Child Document

VR can be created under CR, VAR, or ADD parents that are in IN_EXECUTION state. VR documents are stored in the parent CR's folder, following the same path resolution pattern as VAR and ADD.

**Naming:** `{PARENT_ID}-VR-{NNN}` (e.g., CR-089-VR-001, CR-089-VAR-001-VR-001)

### 5.3 CLI Code Changes

**qms_schema.py:** Add VR to DOC_TYPES and EXECUTABLE_TYPES. Add VR ID pattern supporting nesting under CR, VAR, and ADD.

**qms_config.py:** Add VR entry with `executable: True`, `path: "CR"`.

**qms_paths.py:** Add VR detection in `get_doc_type()` (before ADD check), add VR to nested path resolution in `get_doc_path()` and `get_archive_path()`. Fix `get_next_nested_number()` to resolve deeply nested parents (VAR, ADD) to their top-level CR/INV folder — this also fixes a latent bug for ADD-under-VAR ID generation.

**create.py:** Add VR to parent-required types. Validate parent type (CR, VAR, or ADD) and parent status (IN_EXECUTION). Generate nested VR IDs. After `create_initial_meta()`, override meta for VR: status=IN_EXECUTION, version=1.0, execution_phase=post_release.

### 5.4 EI Table VR Column

EI tables in TEMPLATE-CR, TEMPLATE-VAR, and TEMPLATE-ADD gain a VR column between Task Description and Execution Summary:

```
| EI | Task Description | VR | Execution Summary | Task Outcome | Performed By — Date |
```

VR column values:
- Blank: no VR required for this EI
- `Yes`: VR required (design-time flag, set during drafting)
- `{VR-ID}`: VR created and linked (execution-time, filled during execution)

### 5.5 SOP Updates

**SOP-002:** Simplify Section 6.8 to reference VRs as the integration verification mechanism. Add VR gate to post-review requirements.

**SOP-004:** Add VR to scope. Add VR column to canonical EI table definition. New Section 9C defining VR lifecycle, creation, and content requirements. Update post-review gate.

**SOP-006:** Add VR as third RTM verification type alongside Unit Test and Qualitative Proof.

**SOP-001:** Add VR to definitions and naming conventions.

### 5.6 TEMPLATE-VR

The VR template (drafted in Session-2026-02-16-004) provides structured sections for: Verification Identification, Verification Objective, Pre-Conditions, Procedure, Observations, Outcome (positive/negative/overall), and Signature.

---

## 6. Justification

- Integration verification mandates (CR-084) lack a structured form, enabling compliance that satisfies the letter but not the spirit of verification requirements
- The "mandate escalation cycle" (failure → stronger mandate → weak compliance → failure) is broken by providing form instead of mandate
- VRs create auditable evidence of behavioral testing that can be independently reviewed by QA
- Adding VR as a third RTM verification type closes a traceability gap between requirements and behavioral evidence

### 7.3 Other Impacts

None. VR is additive — no existing functionality is removed or altered.

### 7.4 Development Controls

This CR implements changes to qms-cli, a controlled submodule. Development follows established controls:

1. **Test environment isolation:** Development in a non-QMS-controlled directory (e.g., `.test-env/`, `/projects/` for containerized agents, or other gitignored location)
2. **Branch isolation:** All development on branch `feature/vr-document-type`
3. **Write protection:** `.claude/settings.local.json` blocks direct writes to `qms-cli/`
4. **Qualification required:** All new/modified requirements must have passing tests before merge
5. **CI verification:** Tests must pass on GitHub Actions for dev branch
6. **PR gate:** Changes merge to main only via PR after RS/RTM approval
7. **Submodule update:** Parent repo updates pointer only after PR merge

### 7.5 Qualified State Continuity

| Phase | main branch | RS/RTM Status | Qualified Release |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Before CR | Current commit | EFFECTIVE v14.0/v18.0 | CLI-9.0 |
| During execution | Unchanged | DRAFT (checked out) | CLI-9.0 (unchanged) |
| Post-approval | Merged from feature/vr-document-type | EFFECTIVE v15.0/v19.0 | CLI-10.0 |

---

## 8. Testing Summary

### Automated Verification

Eight new qualification tests covering VR creation, parent validation, initial state, and ID generation:

- `test_create_vr_under_cr` — VR created as child of IN_EXECUTION CR
- `test_create_vr_under_var` — VR created under VAR with nested ID
- `test_create_vr_under_add` — VR created under ADD with nested ID
- `test_vr_requires_parent` — Error when --parent omitted
- `test_vr_rejects_invalid_parent_type` — Error for TP/ER/SOP parent
- `test_vr_requires_in_execution_parent` — Error when parent not IN_EXECUTION
- `test_vr_born_in_execution` — Initial status IN_EXECUTION, v1.0, post_release
- `test_vr_sequential_id_generation` — Sequential VR IDs under same parent

### Integration Verification

- Create a VR under an IN_EXECUTION CR via CLI
- Verify VR is IN_EXECUTION at v1.0 and checked out
- Fill in the VR form, check in
- Route for post-review, verify standard executable workflow operates correctly
- Attempt VR creation with invalid parent type and state, verify rejection
