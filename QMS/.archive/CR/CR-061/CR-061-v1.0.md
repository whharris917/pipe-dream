# CR-061: Launch script Hub integration and obsolete file cleanup

## 1. Purpose

Integrate the Agent Hub (created in CR-060) into the launch workflow and remove files that the Hub has made obsolete. The launch script currently starts a standalone inbox watcher process for multi-agent sessions; the Hub now provides this functionality along with policy-driven auto-start/stop and a REST API. Additionally, several stale artifacts (debug scripts, path-corruption directories, old log files) have accumulated and should be cleaned up.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

- **Parent Document:** CR-060 (Agent Hub genesis)

### 2.2 Changes Summary

1. Update `launch.sh` to start the Agent Hub instead of the standalone inbox watcher
2. Delete obsolete scripts from `docker/scripts/`
3. Delete empty `;C` directories (Docker/Windows path corruption artifacts)
4. Delete stale `.inbox-watcher.log`
5. Update `CLAUDE.md` to remove reference to deleted `start-container.sh`

### 2.3 Files Affected

- `launch.sh` — Replace `start_inbox_watcher()` with `ensure_hub()` function
- `docker/scripts/inbox-watcher.py` — Delete (absorbed by Hub)
- `docker/scripts/start-container.sh` — Delete (superseded by `launch.sh`)
- `docker/scripts/debug-mcp.sh` — Delete (one-off debug script)
- `docker/scripts/test-proxy-reliability.sh` — Delete (one-off test script)
- `docker/scripts/__pycache__/` — Delete (bytecode cache from inbox-watcher)
- `.inbox-watcher.log` — Delete (stale log)
- 8 empty `;C` directories — Delete (path corruption artifacts)
- `CLAUDE.md` — Remove `start-container.sh` from directory tree listing

---

## 3. Current State

`launch.sh` starts a standalone `inbox-watcher.py` process in a separate terminal window for multi-agent sessions. The inbox watcher monitors agent inbox directories and injects tmux notifications into running containers.

`docker/scripts/` contains 4 obsolete files: `inbox-watcher.py` (absorbed by Hub), `start-container.sh` (superseded by `launch.sh`), `debug-mcp.sh` (one-off debug script), and `test-proxy-reliability.sh` (one-off test script).

8 empty directories with `;C` suffixes exist throughout the project tree, created by Docker/Windows path corruption on Feb 4.

A stale `.inbox-watcher.log` file remains at the project root from the last standalone watcher run.

---

## 4. Proposed State

`launch.sh` starts the Agent Hub service if it is not already running. The Hub provides inbox monitoring, notification injection, and policy-based agent lifecycle management via its REST API on port 9000.

`docker/scripts/` contains only actively-used files: `mcp_proxy.py`, `start-mcp-server.sh`, and `start-git-mcp.sh`.

All `;C` path corruption artifacts and stale log files are removed.

---

## 5. Change Description

### 5.1 Launch Script Hub Integration

Replace `start_inbox_watcher()` with `ensure_hub()`:

- Check if the Hub is already running by probing `http://localhost:9000/api/health`
- If not running, start it as a background process using `agent-hub start`
- Write PID to `.agent-hub.pid` for later cleanup (consistent with MCP server PID pattern)
- Wait for health check to confirm startup
- Remove `start_inbox_watcher()` function and `.inbox-watcher.pid` handling
- Update post-session info to include Hub in the cleanup message

### 5.2 Obsolete File Deletion

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `docker/scripts/inbox-watcher.py` | Fully absorbed by `agent_hub/inbox.py` + `agent_hub/notifier.py` |
| `docker/scripts/start-container.sh` | Superseded by `launch.sh`; references deprecated SSE endpoint |
| `docker/scripts/debug-mcp.sh` | One-off debug script with hardcoded auth headers |
| `docker/scripts/test-proxy-reliability.sh` | One-off test script for proxy investigation |
| `docker/scripts/__pycache__/` | Bytecode cache, no source remains |
| `.inbox-watcher.log` | Stale log from standalone watcher |

### 5.3 Path Corruption Cleanup

Delete 8 empty directories created by Docker/Windows path mangling on Feb 4:

- `.claude/agents/qa.md;C`
- `.claude/sessions;C`
- `.claude/users/claude/container;C`
- `.claude/users/claude/workspace;C`
- `.claude/users/qa/container;C`
- `.claude/users/qa/workspace;C`
- `docker/.claude-settings.json;C`
- `docker/.mcp.json;C`

### 5.4 CLAUDE.md Update

Remove `start-container.sh` from the `docker/scripts/` directory listing in the Container Infrastructure section, as the file no longer exists.

---

## 6. Justification

- The Hub provides a superset of inbox watcher functionality (monitoring, notification, plus policy engine and REST API). Keeping the standalone script creates confusion about which to use.
- Obsolete scripts accumulate maintenance debt and mislead developers about the active toolchain.
- The `;C` directories are visual clutter and could confuse filesystem operations.
- Removing stale artifacts keeps the repository clean and navigable.

## 7. Impact Assessment

### 7.1 Files Affected

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `launch.sh` | Modify | Replace inbox watcher with Hub startup |
| `docker/scripts/inbox-watcher.py` | Delete | Absorbed by Hub |
| `docker/scripts/start-container.sh` | Delete | Superseded by launch.sh |
| `docker/scripts/debug-mcp.sh` | Delete | One-off debug script |
| `docker/scripts/test-proxy-reliability.sh` | Delete | One-off test script |
| `docker/scripts/__pycache__/` | Delete | Stale bytecode cache |
| `.inbox-watcher.log` | Delete | Stale log file |
| 8 `;C` directories | Delete | Empty path corruption artifacts |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Modify | Remove deleted file reference |

### 7.2 Documents Affected

| Document | Change Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| CLAUDE.md | Modify | Remove `start-container.sh` from directory tree |

### 7.3 Other Impacts

None. The `mcp_proxy.py` script remains in place (actively used by Docker image). MCP server start scripts remain in place.

---

## 8. Testing Summary

- Verify `launch.sh` starts the Hub when not running (health check succeeds after startup)
- Verify `launch.sh` skips Hub startup when already running
- Verify single-agent mode still works end-to-end
- Verify multi-agent mode launches Hub instead of inbox watcher
- Verify no broken references to deleted files remain in tracked files

---

## 9. Implementation Plan

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Delete obsolete files from `docker/scripts/` |
| 2 | Delete `;C` directories and `.inbox-watcher.log` |
| 3 | Update `launch.sh`: replace `start_inbox_watcher()` with `ensure_hub()` |
| 4 | Update `CLAUDE.md`: remove `start-container.sh` reference |
| 5 | Test launch.sh in single-agent and multi-agent modes |
