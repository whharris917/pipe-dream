# CR-065: Fix MCP qms_review argument mapping and strengthen equivalence tests

## 1. Purpose

Fix a defect in the MCP `qms_review` tool that prevents agents from submitting reviews via MCP, and strengthen all MCP equivalence tests to call through the MCP tool layer rather than only exercising CLI commands.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

Discovered during CR-064 pre-review in Session 2026-02-08-001. The QA agent attempted to submit a review via the MCP `qms_review` tool with `outcome="request-updates"`. The tool passed `["review", "CR-064", "--outcome", "request-updates"]` to the CLI, but the CLI has no `--outcome` argument -- it expects `--recommend` or `--request-updates` as standalone boolean flags. The review submission failed, blocking the entire QMS review workflow for containerized agents.

- **Parent Document:** None (discovered during exploratory testing)

### 2.2 Changes Summary

1. Fix the argument mapping in `qms_review` (one-line fix)
2. Audit all other MCP tool argument mappings for similar defects (completed during drafting: no others found)
3. Strengthen equivalence tests to call MCP tool functions directly, verifying the argument mapping layer that the current tests miss

### 2.3 Files Affected

- `qms-cli/qms_mcp/tools.py` -- Fix `qms_review` argument mapping
- `qms-cli/tests/qualification/test_mcp.py` -- Strengthen equivalence tests to exercise MCP tool layer

---

## 3. Current State

The `qms_review` function in `tools.py` line 333 constructs CLI arguments as:
```python
args = ["review", doc_id, "--outcome", outcome]
```

The CLI (`commands/review.py` lines 29-30) defines `--recommend` and `--request-updates` as mutually exclusive `store_true` flags in an argument group. There is no `--outcome` argument.

The existing equivalence test `test_qms_review_equivalence` calls the CLI directly via `run_qms()` with `--recommend`, which succeeds. It never exercises the MCP tool function `qms_review()`, so the argument mapping defect was not caught.

This same pattern applies to all equivalence tests: they verify CLI behavior but do not test the MCP tool-to-CLI argument mapping layer.

---

## 4. Proposed State

The `qms_review` function constructs CLI arguments as:
```python
args = ["review", doc_id, f"--{outcome}"]
```

This maps `outcome="recommend"` to `--recommend` and `outcome="request-updates"` to `--request-updates`, matching the CLI's expected flag format. This is the same pattern already used by `qms_route` (line 276).

Equivalence tests are strengthened to call the MCP tool functions directly (via `register_tools` with a real `run_qms_command`), verifying the complete path from MCP parameter to CLI execution. At minimum, `qms_review` and `qms_route` (the two tools that perform parameter-to-flag mapping) get direct MCP-layer tests. Ideally, all equivalence tests gain MCP-layer coverage.

---

## 5. Change Description

### 5.1 Bug Fix (`tools.py`)

Change line 333 from:
```python
args = ["review", doc_id, "--outcome", outcome]
```
to:
```python
args = ["review", doc_id, f"--{outcome}"]
```

### 5.2 Audit Results

All other MCP tools were audited for similar parameter mapping defects:

| Tool | Mapping Pattern | Status |
|------|----------------|--------|
| `qms_route` | `f"--{route_type}"` | Correct |
| `qms_review` | `"--outcome", outcome` | **BUG** -- should be `f"--{outcome}"` |
| `qms_reject` | `"--comment", comment` | Correct (value arg, not flag) |
| `qms_revert` | `"--reason", reason` | Correct (value arg, not flag) |
| `qms_cancel` | `"--confirm"` | Correct (hardcoded flag) |
| `qms_read` | `"--version", version` / `"--draft"` | Correct |
| `qms_assign` | `"--assignees"` + list | Correct |
| All others | Direct positional args | Correct |

`qms_review` is the only defective mapping.

### 5.3 Test Strengthening (`test_mcp.py`)

Current equivalence tests follow this pattern:
```python
def test_qms_review_equivalence(temp_project):
    # Setup: create doc, route for review
    cli_result = run_qms(temp_project, "qa", "review", "SOP-001",
                         "--recommend", "--comment", "Looks good")
    assert cli_result.returncode == 0
```

This tests the CLI path only. It does not test `qms_review(doc_id="SOP-001", outcome="recommend", comment="Looks good")`.

New tests will call the MCP tool function with its native parameters, verifying the complete path including argument mapping. Both `recommend` and `request-updates` outcomes will be tested for `qms_review`. Other tools with parameter-to-flag mappings (`qms_route`) will also get MCP-layer coverage.

---

## 6. Justification

- **Problem:** Containerized agents cannot submit reviews via MCP. This completely blocks the autonomous review workflow.
- **Impact of not fixing:** All Hub-orchestrated reviews fail. QA and TU agents in containers cannot perform their core function without manual CLI intervention.
- **Root cause:** Incorrect argument mapping in `qms_review` (uses non-existent `--outcome` flag) combined with insufficient test coverage (equivalence tests bypass the MCP tool layer).

---

## 7. Impact Assessment

### 7.1 Files Affected

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `qms-cli/qms_mcp/tools.py` | Modify | Fix `qms_review` argument mapping (line 333) |
| `qms-cli/tests/qualification/test_mcp.py` | Modify | Add MCP-layer equivalence tests |

### 7.2 Documents Affected

| Document | Change Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| SDLC-QMS-RTM | Modify | Update qualified baseline with new commit and test counts (v9.0 -> v10.0) |

Note: RS revision is driven by CR-049 (adding `qms_withdraw` to REQ-MCP-004), not by this CR. This CR fixes a violation of existing requirements (REQ-MCP-004, REQ-MCP-007), not a gap in requirements.

### 7.3 Other Impacts

None. The fix changes only the MCP tool layer's argument construction. The CLI, workflow engine, and all other subsystems are unaffected.

### 7.4 Development Controls

This CR implements changes to qms-cli, a controlled submodule. Development follows established controls:

1. **Test environment isolation:** Development in a non-QMS-controlled directory (e.g., `.test-env/` or `/projects/` for containerized agents)
2. **Branch isolation:** All development on branch `cr-049-065-requalification` (shared with CR-049)
3. **Write protection:** `.claude/settings.local.json` blocks direct writes to `qms-cli/`
4. **Qualification required:** All new/modified requirements must have passing tests before merge
5. **CI verification:** Tests must pass on GitHub Actions for dev branch
6. **PR gate:** Changes merge to main only via PR after RS/RTM approval
7. **Submodule update:** Parent repo updates pointer only after PR merge

### 7.5 Qualified State Continuity

| Phase | main branch | RS/RTM Status | Qualified Release |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Before CR | Commit 63123fe | EFFECTIVE RS v7.0 / RTM v9.0 | QMS-CLI current |
| During execution | Unchanged | RS/RTM checked out for updates | QMS-CLI current (unchanged) |
| Post-approval | Merged from cr-049-065-requalification | EFFECTIVE RS v8.0 / RTM v10.0 | QMS-CLI next |

Note: RS v7.0 -> v8.0 is driven by CR-049 (adding `qms_withdraw` to REQ-MCP-004). This CR shares a requalification branch, CI run, RTM update, and PR merge with CR-049. Both CRs reference the same qualified commit hash.

---

## 8. Testing Summary

- Verify `qms_review` with `outcome="recommend"` succeeds via MCP tool function
- Verify `qms_review` with `outcome="request-updates"` succeeds via MCP tool function
- Verify all other equivalence tests continue to pass
- Full requalification: all tests passing at qualified commit (combined with CR-049 changes)

---

## 9. Implementation Plan

### 9.1 Phase 1: Test Environment Setup

1. Clone/update qms-cli to a non-QMS-controlled working directory
2. Create and checkout branch `cr-049-065-requalification` (shared with CR-049)
3. Verify clean test environment (all existing tests pass)

### 9.2 Phase 2: Implementation

1. Fix `qms_review` argument mapping in `tools.py` line 333
2. Add MCP-layer equivalence tests that call `qms_review()` through `register_tools` with both `recommend` and `request-updates` outcomes
3. Audit and strengthen other equivalence tests as appropriate

### 9.3 Phase 3: Qualification

1. Run full test suite, verify all tests pass (combined with CR-049 changes)
2. Push to dev branch
3. Verify GitHub Actions CI passes
4. Document qualified commit hash

### 9.4 Phase 4: RTM Update and Approval

1. Checkout SDLC-QMS-RTM
2. Update qualified baseline with CI-verified commit and updated test counts
3. Checkin RTM, route for review and approval
4. **Verify RTM reaches EFFECTIVE status before proceeding to Phase 5**

### 9.5 Phase 5: Merge and Submodule Update

**Prerequisite:** RS and RTM must be EFFECTIVE before proceeding (per SOP-006 Section 7.4).

1. Verify RS and RTM are EFFECTIVE
2. Create PR to merge `cr-049-065-requalification` to main
3. Merge PR
4. Update submodule pointer in parent repo
5. Verify MCP review works in production context

Note: Phases 1, 3, 4, and 5 are shared with CR-049 and executed once for both CRs.
