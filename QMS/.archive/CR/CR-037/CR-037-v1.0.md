# CR-037: SOP-001 alignment with SDLC-QMS-RS

## 1. Purpose

This CR aligns SOP-001 (Document Control) with the current effective SDLC-QMS-RS (QMS CLI Requirements Specification). An audit revealed that SOP-001 uses outdated group names, lists specific user identifiers instead of generic group references, contains incorrect permission assignments, and includes document types not supported by the qualified CLI.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

During CR-036 execution, documentation drift was identified between SOP-001 and the qualified qms-cli system. This CR corrects SOP-001 to accurately reflect the RS.

- **Parent Document:** CR-036-VAR-002

### 2.2 Changes Summary

1. **Section 4.1 User Groups:** Update group names and remove specific user IDs
2. **Section 4.2 Permission Matrix:** Correct permissions per RS REQ-SEC-002 and REQ-SEC-004
3. **Section 4.3 Responsibilities:** Update group names
4. **Section 6.1 Document Naming:** Remove CAPA (not a document type per REQ-DOC-001)
5. **Section 8.1 Status Table:** Remove SUPERSEDED (not in RS state machine)

### 2.3 Files Affected

- `QMS/SOP/SOP-001.md` - Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 6.1, 8.1, 8.3

---

## 3. Current State

SOP-001 Section 4.1 uses group names "Initiators", "QA", "Reviewers" and lists specific user identifiers (lead, claude, qa, tu_ui, etc.).

SOP-001 Section 4.2 shows QA having `route, release, close` and `fix` permissions. It shows "lead only" for fix. It omits the `revert` action.

SOP-001 Section 6.1 lists "CAPA (child of INV)" as a document type.

SOP-001 Section 8.1 lists SUPERSEDED as a document status.

---

## 4. Proposed State

SOP-001 Section 4.1 uses group names "Administrator", "Initiator", "Quality", "Reviewer" per RS Section 3.2. No specific user identifiers are listed; group membership is determined by agent definition files per REQ-USER-002.

SOP-001 Section 4.2 accurately reflects RS permissions:
- Only Administrator and Initiator groups can route, release, revert, close
- Only Administrator group can fix
- Only Quality and Reviewer groups can approve/reject

SOP-001 Section 6.1 lists only document types defined in REQ-DOC-001.

SOP-001 Section 8.1 lists only statuses defined in REQ-WF-002.

---

## 5. Change Description

### 5.1 Section 4.1 User Groups

**Current:**
```
| Group | Members | Role |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Initiators** | lead, claude | Create and manage documents through workflow |
| **QA** | qa | Mandatory reviewer/approver; assigns Technical Units |
| **Reviewers** | tu_ui, tu_scene, tu_sketch, tu_sim, bu | Domain experts assigned by QA |
```

**Proposed:**
```
| Group | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Administrator** | All Initiator permissions plus administrative commands (fix). Inherits Initiator permissions per REQ-SEC-001. |
| **Initiator** | Create and manage documents through workflow |
| **Quality** | Assign reviewers; review and approve documents |
| **Reviewer** | Review and approve assigned documents |
```

Note: Specific user-to-group assignments are managed via agent definition files (`.claude/agents/{user}.md`) per REQ-USER-002, not in this SOP.

### 5.2 Section 4.2 Permission Matrix

**Current:**
```
| Action | Initiators | QA | Reviewers |
|--------|------------|-----|-----------|
| create, checkout, checkin | Yes | - | - |
| route, release, close | Yes | Yes | - |
| assign | - | Yes | - |
| review | When assigned | Yes | When assigned |
| approve, reject | - | Yes | When assigned |
| fix (admin) | lead only | Yes | - |
```

**Proposed (per REQ-SEC-002, REQ-SEC-004, REQ-SEC-005):**
```
| Action | Administrator | Initiator | Quality | Reviewer |
|--------|---------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| create, checkout, checkin | Yes | Yes | - | - |
| route, release, revert, close | Yes | Yes | - | - |
| assign | - | - | Yes | - |
| review | When assigned | When assigned | When assigned | When assigned |
| approve, reject | - | - | When assigned | When assigned |
| fix | Yes | - | - | - |
```

### 5.3 Section 4.3 Responsibilities

Update group names from "Initiators/QA/Reviewers" to "Administrator/Initiator/Quality/Reviewer". Add note that Administrator inherits Initiator responsibilities.

### 5.4 Section 6.1 Document Naming Convention

**Remove row:**
```
| CAPA (child of INV) | INV-NNN-CAPA-NNN | INV-001-CAPA-002 |
```

CAPA is not a document type per REQ-DOC-001. CAPAs are execution items within Investigations.

### 5.5 Section 8.1 and 8.3 Status Tables

**Remove from Section 8.1:**
```
| SUPERSEDED | Document has been replaced by a newer version |
```

**Remove from Section 8.3:**
```
| SUPERSEDED | Non-executable | Replaced by newer version |
```

SUPERSEDED is not defined in REQ-WF-002. When a new version becomes effective, the previous version is archived; there is no explicit SUPERSEDED status transition.

---

## 6. Justification

- **Accuracy:** SOPs must accurately reflect the qualified system (SDLC-QMS-RS)
- **Generic design:** Removing specific user IDs allows group membership to be managed via agent files without requiring SOP revisions
- **Permission correctness:** Current SOP grants permissions that the CLI will reject (e.g., QA routing), causing confusion
- **Document type alignment:** Listing CAPA as a document type contradicts REQ-DOC-001 and SOP-003

---

## 7. Impact Assessment

### 7.1 Files Affected

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `QMS/SOP/SOP-001.md` | Modify | Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 6.1, 8.1, 8.3 |

### 7.2 Documents Affected

| Document | Change Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| SOP-001 | Modify | User groups, permissions, document types, statuses |

### 7.3 Other Impacts

None. This CR corrects documentation only; no code changes required.

---

## 8. Testing Summary

- Verify Section 4.1 contains no specific user identifiers
- Verify Section 4.2 permission matrix matches RS REQ-SEC-002/004/005
- Verify Section 6.1 does not list CAPA: `grep -c "CAPA" QMS/SOP/SOP-001.md` returns 0
- Verify Section 8.1 does not list SUPERSEDED: `grep -c "SUPERSEDED" QMS/SOP/SOP-001.md` returns 0
