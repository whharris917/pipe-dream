# CR-008: SOP-002 Post-Review Gate - Require Completed Documentation Approvals

## 1. Purpose

Strengthen the post-review gate in SOP-002 to explicitly require that all documentation changes associated with a CR are approved and effective before the CR can proceed to post-approval.

---

## 2. Scope

This change affects:
- **SOP-002** Section 7 (CR Workflow) - Add new Section 7.3 Post-Review Requirements

---

## 3. Rationale

**Problem Identified:**

INV-001 documented a procedural nonconformance where CR-005 was post-approved and closed despite having incomplete scope items (SOP-001 and SOP-002 updates were not executed). The root cause was inadequate scope change control during execution—when obstacles arose, incomplete work was rationalized rather than formally tracked.

**Current Gap:**

SOP-002 Section 7.2 describes execution but does not explicitly state the completion criteria for post-review eligibility. There is no procedural requirement that:
1. All execution items must be complete before routing for post-review
2. Documentation changes (SOP updates) must be approved and effective
3. QA must verify these conditions during post-review

**Proposed Solution:**

Add Section 7.3 "Post-Review Requirements" to SOP-002 that:
1. Defines post-review eligibility criteria
2. Specifies QA's verification responsibilities during post-review
3. Explicitly requires associated documentation to be approved/effective

## 5. Proposed Text for Section 7.3

```markdown
### 7.3 Post-Review Requirements

A CR may only be routed for post-review when **all** of the following conditions are met:

1. **Execution Complete:** All execution items documented in the CR have been completed or formally deferred with follow-up references

2. **Documentation Approved:** Any controlled documents (SOPs, specifications) modified under the CR have completed their own review/approval workflows and are EFFECTIVE

3. **Evidence Documented:** Completion evidence is recorded in the CR's execution item table

**QA Post-Review Verification:**

During post-review, the QA representative shall verify:

- All execution items show status COMPLETE or DEFERRED (with valid follow-up reference)
- Any SOPs or controlled documents listed in scope are EFFECTIVE (not DRAFT or IN_REVIEW)
- The CR's revision_summary requirements (Section 8) have been applied to modified documents

If any condition is not met, QA shall submit review with `--request-updates` and document the deficiency.
```

## 6. Testing Summary

Manual verification that:
1. Section 7.3 is present in SOP-002 after approval
2. Post-review requirements are clearly stated
3. QA verification responsibilities are explicit
