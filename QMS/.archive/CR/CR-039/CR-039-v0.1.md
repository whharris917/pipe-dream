# CR-039: SOP-003 alignment corrections

## 1. Purpose

This CR corrects alignment issues in SOP-003 (Deviation Management) identified during the SOP documentation audit. SOP-003 contains a reference to a specific user identifier and an outdated CAPA numbering format.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

Following CR-037 and CR-038, which aligned SOP-001 and SOP-002 with SDLC-QMS-RS, an audit of SOP-003 revealed similar issues requiring correction.

- **Parent Document:** CR-038 (continuation of SOP alignment effort)

### 2.2 Changes Summary

1. **Section 4:** Replace "Lead" with generic terminology
2. **Section 6:** Update CAPA identification approach to align with execution item conventions

### 2.3 Files Affected

- `QMS/SOP/SOP-003.md` - Sections 4, 6

---

## 3. Current State

SOP-003 Section 4 states "The Lead has discretion to determine when an INV is warranted." The capitalized "Lead" could be confused with the user ID "lead".

SOP-003 Section 6 states CAPAs are "numbered as `INV-XYZ-CAPA-NNN`". This document-like numbering format was removed from SOP-001 Section 6.1 (CR-037). Since CAPAs are execution items, not documents, they should follow execution item identification conventions.

---

## 4. Proposed State

SOP-003 Section 4 uses generic terminology ("project authority") that does not reference specific user identifiers.

SOP-003 Section 6 describes CAPAs as execution items identified within the INV's execution table, consistent with how other execution items (EI-1, EI-2, etc.) are handled.

---

## 5. Change Description

### 5.1 Section 4

**Current:**
```
The Lead has discretion to determine when an INV is warranted.
```

**Proposed:**
```
The project authority has discretion to determine when an INV is warranted.
```

### 5.2 Section 6 (line 150)

**Current:**
```
CAPAs are not standalone documents. They are execution items within Investigations, numbered as `INV-XYZ-CAPA-NNN`.
```

**Proposed:**
```
CAPAs are not standalone documents. They are execution items within Investigations, identified in the execution table (e.g., CAPA-1, CAPA-2).
```

---

## 6. Justification

- **Consistency:** SOPs should not reference specific user identifiers per SOP-001/SOP-002 alignment principles
- **Alignment:** CAPA numbering format was removed from SOP-001 Section 6.1; SOP-003 should align
- **Clarity:** Execution items should follow execution item conventions, not document naming conventions

## 7. Impact Assessment

### 7.1 Files Affected

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `QMS/SOP/SOP-003.md` | Modify | Sections 4, 6 |

### 7.2 Documents Affected

| Document | Change Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| SOP-003 | Modify | Sections 4, 6 |

### 7.3 Other Impacts

None. This CR corrects documentation only; no code changes required.

---

## 8. Testing Summary

- Verify Section 4 does not contain "Lead": `grep -c "The Lead" QMS/SOP/SOP-003.md` returns 0
- Verify Section 6 does not contain old CAPA numbering: `grep -c "INV-XYZ-CAPA-NNN" QMS/SOP/SOP-003.md` returns 0

---

## 9. Implementation Plan

### 9.1 SOP-003 Updates

1. Checkout SOP-003
2. Update Section 4 (replace "Lead" with "project authority")
3. Update Section 6 (update CAPA identification wording)
4. Update revision_summary to reference CR-039
5. Checkin SOP-003
6. Route for review and complete approval cycle
