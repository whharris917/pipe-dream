# CR-027: Extract Prompts to External YAML Files

## 1. Purpose

Extract hard-coded prompt configurations from `prompts.py` into external YAML files in `qms-cli/prompts/`, making them easier to maintain, review, and trace to requirements in future SDLC documentation.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

Independent improvement identified during architectural review (Session-2026-01-11-002). Prompts contain review checklists that must align with SOP requirements. Extracting them to files enables future traceability via SDLC-QMS-RS/RTM.

- **Parent Document:** None

### 2.2 Changes Summary

- Create `qms-cli/prompts/` directory with YAML prompt files
- Modify `prompts.py` to load prompts from files with fallback chain
- Fix bug where `doc_type` is not passed to prompt generation functions

### 2.3 Files Affected

- `qms-cli/prompts/` - New directory with YAML prompt files
- `qms-cli/prompts.py` - Add file loading, maintain PromptRegistry interface
- `qms-cli/commands/route.py` - Pass doc_type to template functions
- `qms-cli/commands/assign.py` - Pass doc_type to template functions

---

## 3. Current State

Prompt configurations (checklist items, critical reminders) are hard-coded in `prompts.py`. The PromptRegistry selects configurations based on task_type, workflow_type, and doc_type using an in-memory dictionary. A bug prevents doc_type from being passed to prompt generation, so doc-type-specific prompts (CR execution checks, SOP procedure checks) do not work correctly.

---

## 4. Proposed State

Prompt configurations are stored as YAML files in `qms-cli/prompts/`. The directory structure mirrors the lookup chain: `{task_type}/{workflow_type}/{doc_type}.yaml`. The PromptRegistry loads configurations from files with a fallback chain. The doc_type bug is fixed, enabling doc-type-specific prompts.

---

## 5. Change Description

### 5.1 Directory Structure

```
qms-cli/prompts/
├── review/                          # task_type = REVIEW
│   ├── default.yaml                 # Fallback for any review workflow
│   ├── review/                      # workflow_type = REVIEW (non-executable)
│   │   ├── default.yaml
│   │   └── sop.yaml                 # doc_type = SOP
│   ├── pre_review/                  # workflow_type = PRE_REVIEW
│   │   └── default.yaml
│   └── post_review/                 # workflow_type = POST_REVIEW
│       ├── default.yaml
│       └── cr.yaml                  # doc_type = CR
│
└── approval/                        # task_type = APPROVAL
    ├── default.yaml                 # Fallback for any approval workflow
    ├── approval/                    # workflow_type = APPROVAL (non-executable)
    │   └── default.yaml
    ├── pre_approval/                # workflow_type = PRE_APPROVAL
    │   └── default.yaml
    └── post_approval/               # workflow_type = POST_APPROVAL
        └── default.yaml
```

### 5.2 YAML File Format

```yaml
checklist:
  - category: Frontmatter
    items:
      - text: "`title:` field present and non-empty"
        evidence_prompt: "quote actual value"

critical_reminders:
  - "**Compliance is BINARY**: Document is either compliant or non-compliant"

custom_header: null
custom_footer: null
```

### 5.3 Lookup Logic

Fallback chain (mirrors current PromptRegistry.get_config):
1. `{task_type}/{workflow_type}/{doc_type}.yaml` (exact match)
2. `{task_type}/{workflow_type}/default.yaml` (any doc_type)
3. `{task_type}/default.yaml` (any workflow_type)

### 5.4 Bug Fix

In `route.py` and `assign.py`, add `doc_type=doc_type` parameter to calls to `generate_review_task_content()` and `generate_approval_task_content()`.

---

## 6. Justification

- **Problem:** Prompts are hard-coded, making them difficult to maintain and trace to SOPs
- **Impact of not making this change:** Prompts may drift out of alignment with SOP requirements; no traceability for future SDLC documentation
- **Solution:** External files enable easier review, maintenance, and future traceability via RTM

## 7. Impact Assessment

### 7.1 Files Affected

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `qms-cli/prompts/` | Create | New directory with YAML prompt files |
| `qms-cli/prompts.py` | Modify | Add file loading with fallback chain |
| `qms-cli/commands/route.py` | Modify | Pass doc_type to template functions |
| `qms-cli/commands/assign.py` | Modify | Pass doc_type to template functions |
| `qms-cli/tests/test_prompts.py` | Modify | Add tests for file loading |

### 7.2 Documents Affected

| Document | Change Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| None | - | No QMS documents affected |

### 7.3 Other Impacts

None. This is an internal refactoring with no change to external CLI behavior.

---

## 8. Testing Summary

- Existing prompt tests continue to pass
- New tests verify YAML loading and fallback chain
- Manual verification: Route CR for post-review, verify CR-specific execution checks appear
- Manual verification: Route SOP for review, verify SOP-specific procedure checks appear
- Manual verification: Route INV for review, verify default checks appear (fallback)

---

## 9. Implementation Plan

### 9.1 Create Directory Structure and YAML Files

1. Create `qms-cli/prompts/` directory tree
2. Extract DEFAULT_FRONTMATTER_CHECKS to default review YAML
3. Extract DEFAULT_STRUCTURE_CHECKS to default review YAML
4. Extract DEFAULT_CONTENT_CHECKS to default review YAML
5. Extract CR_EXECUTION_CHECKS to `review/post_review/cr.yaml`
6. Extract SOP_CHECKS to `review/review/sop.yaml`
7. Extract DEFAULT_CRITICAL_REMINDERS to review defaults
8. Extract APPROVAL_CRITICAL_REMINDERS to approval defaults

### 9.2 Add File Loading to prompts.py

1. Add `load_prompt_config()` function with file path construction
2. Implement fallback chain using file existence checks
3. Parse YAML into PromptConfig dataclass
4. Add caching to avoid repeated file reads
5. Update PromptRegistry.get_config() to use file loading

### 9.3 Fix doc_type Passthrough Bug

1. In `route.py`: Add `doc_type=doc_type` to generate_*_task_content() calls
2. In `assign.py`: Add `doc_type=doc_type` to generate_*_task_content() calls

### 9.4 Update Tests

1. Add test for YAML file loading
2. Add test for fallback chain with files
3. Verify existing tests pass
