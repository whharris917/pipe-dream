# CR-079: Multi-Agent Integration Test

## 1. Purpose

This is a test CR to validate multi-agent QMS workflows. It exercises the full document lifecycle — creation, drafting, review, approval, execution, and closure — to confirm that orchestrating agent (claude), QA, and TU agents can interact correctly through the QMS MCP tooling.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

Independent test to validate multi-agent QMS integration.

- **Parent Document:** None

### 2.2 Changes Summary

No code or document changes. This CR exists solely to exercise the QMS workflow pipeline with multiple agents.

### 2.3 Files Affected

No files affected. This is a workflow validation CR only.

---

## 3. Current State

Multi-agent QMS workflows have not been formally validated end-to-end in a single test CR.

---

## 4. Proposed State

A completed test CR demonstrates that the multi-agent QMS pipeline (create, draft, review, approve, execute, close) functions correctly.

---

## 5. Change Description

### 5.1 Workflow Validation

This CR validates the following workflow steps:
1. CR creation via MCP tools
2. Drafting and check-in
3. Pre-review routing and reviewer assignment
4. Pre-approval routing and approval
5. Release for execution
6. Post-review and post-approval
7. Closure

No code or controlled document modifications are performed.

---

## 6. Justification

- Validates that multi-agent QMS workflows function end-to-end
- Confirms MCP tooling supports the full CR lifecycle
- Provides a low-risk vehicle for integration testing

---

## 7. Impact Assessment

### 7.1 Files Affected

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| None | N/A | No files modified |

### 7.2 Documents Affected

| Document | Change Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| CR-079 | Create | This test CR |

### 7.3 Other Impacts

None.

---

## 8. Testing Summary

- Verify CR progresses through all workflow states without error
- Verify each agent role (claude, qa, TU reviewers) can perform their assigned actions
- Verify audit trail captures all state transitions

---

## 9. Implementation Plan

### 9.1 Phase 1: Workflow Execution

1. Progress CR through all lifecycle stages
2. Verify each transition succeeds

---

## 10. Execution

EXECUTION PHASE INSTRUCTIONS
============================
NOTE: Do NOT delete this comment block. It provides guidance for execution.

- Sections 1-9 are PRE-APPROVED content - do NOT modify during execution
- Only THIS TABLE and the comment sections below should be edited during execution phase

COLUMNS:
- EI: Execution item identifier
- Task Description: What to do (static, from Implementation Plan)
- Execution Summary: Narrative of what was done, evidence, observations (editable)
- Task Outcome: Pass or Fail (editable)
- Performed By - Date: Signature (editable)

TASK OUTCOME:
- Pass: Task completed as planned
- Fail: Task could not be completed as planned - attach VAR with explanation

VAR TYPES (see VAR-TEMPLATE):
- Type 1: Use when the failed task is critical to CR objectives
- Type 2: Use when impact is contained and CR can conceptually close

EXECUTION SUMMARY EXAMPLES:
- "Implemented per plan. Commit abc123."
- "Modified src/module.py:45-67. Unit tests passing."
- "Created SOP-007 (now EFFECTIVE)."
