# CR-015: SOP-006 Creation and SOP Internal Consistency

## 1. Purpose

Create SOP-006 (SDLC Governance) from the approved workshop draft and update SOPs 001 and 005 for internal consistency.

---

## 2. Description

### 2.1 Current State

- SOP-006 exists only as a workshop draft (`.claude/workshop/SOP-006-SDLC-Governance-DRAFT.md`)
- SOP-001 lists DS, CS, OQ as SDLC document types, conflicting with SOP-006's streamlined RS+RTM approach
- SOP-001 lists CAPA as an Executable Document, but SOP-003 and SOP-004 define CAPAs as execution items within INVs (not standalone documents)
- SOP-005 contains DS references in examples and descriptions

### 2.2 Proposed State

- SOP-006 exists as an effective SOP governing SDLC documentation
- SOP-001 references only RS and RTM as SDLC document types
- SOP-001 correctly classifies CAPAs as EIs (not documents), while retaining the CAPA naming convention
- SOP-005 examples show only RS.md and RTM.md

### 2.3 Affected Documents

| Document | Action |
|----------|--------|
| SOP-006 | CREATE |
| SOP-001 | MODIFY |
| SOP-005 | MODIFY |

---

## 3. Rationale

### 3.1 Why This Change is Necessary

1. **SDLC Simplification:** The workshop draft of SOP-006 establishes that only RS (Requirements Specification) and RTM (Requirements Traceability Matrix) are required for system qualification. DS, CS, and OQ are eliminated as unnecessary documentation overhead.

2. **CAPA Classification Conflict:** SOP-001 incorrectly lists CAPA as a document type, when SOP-003 Section 6 and SOP-004 Section 2 both state: "CAPAs are not standalone documents; they are execution items within INVs."

3. **Internal Consistency:** The SOPs must be internally consistent. This CR resolves the conflicts identified in the consistency check.

---

## 4. Testing Summary

Manual verification of:
- SOP-001 no longer contains DS, CS, OQ references (except naming convention history)
- SOP-001 no longer lists CAPA as a document type (but retains naming convention for EIs)
- SOP-005 examples show only RS.md and RTM.md
- SOP-006 exists with valid cross-references to SOP-001, SOP-002, SOP-005
- All revision_summary fields reference CR-015

## 5. Execution Plan

### EI-1: Create SOP-006

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Task Description** | Create SOP-006 from workshop draft. Copy `.claude/workshop/SOP-006-SDLC-Governance-DRAFT.md` to `QMS/SOP/SOP-006.md` with frontmatter `revision_summary: 'Initial creation'`. |
| **Execution Summary** | |
| **Task Outcome** | |
| **Performed By / Date** | |

### EI-2: Update SOP-001 - Remove DS, CS, OQ and Fix CAPA Classification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Task Description** | Remove DS, CS, OQ from document type lists (lines 28, 44, 251-252, 254, 312). Remove CAPA from executable document definitions (lines 24, 43, 325). KEEP CAPA naming convention (line 246) for documenting EI naming. Set frontmatter `revision_summary: 'CR-015: Remove DS, CS, OQ; fix CAPA classification per SOP-006'`. |
| **Execution Summary** | |
| **Task Outcome** | |
| **Performed By / Date** | |

### EI-3: Update SOP-005 - Align SDLC References

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Task Description** | Remove DS.md from repository examples (lines 87, 91, 230). Change "(DS, RTM)" to "(RS, RTM)" (line 101). Change "(RS, DS, RTM)" to "(RS, RTM)" (line 200). Update DS.md references to RS.md or RTM.md (lines 291, 297, 323). Set frontmatter `revision_summary: 'CR-015: Align SDLC document types with SOP-006'`. |
| **Execution Summary** | |
| **Task Outcome** | |
| **Performed By / Date** | |

## 6. Out of Scope

- Template alignment with SOPs (future CR)
- TP naming convention harmonization (future CR)
- "Pass with Exceptions" formalization (future CR)
