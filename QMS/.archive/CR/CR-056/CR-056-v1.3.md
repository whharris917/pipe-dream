# CR-056: Multi-Agent Container Session Infrastructure

## 1. Purpose

Enable multiple QMS agents (claude, qa, tu_*, bu) to run simultaneously in separate containers, with automatic notification when new tasks arrive in their inboxes. This is the "Multi-Agent Session" rung on the ladder toward full GUI-based agent orchestration.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

This CR implements infrastructure designed in Sessions 2026-02-03-003 and 2026-02-04-002, building on the existing `claude-session.sh` single-agent launcher.

- **Parent Document:** None (independent infrastructure improvement)

### 2.2 Changes Summary

1. Extend `claude-session.sh` to support any QMS agent (not just claude)
2. Migrate from Docker named volume to per-agent bind mounts for container config
3. Create `multi-agent-session.sh` to launch multiple agents simultaneously
4. Create `inbox-watcher.py` to monitor inboxes and notify agents of new tasks

### 2.3 Files Affected

- `claude-session.sh` - Add agent parameter, mount agent-specific CLAUDE.md
- `docker/docker-compose.yml` - Replace named volume with per-agent bind mount
- `docker/multi-agent-session.sh` - New file: multi-agent launcher
- `docker/scripts/inbox-watcher.py` - New file: cross-platform inbox watcher
- `.claude/users/*/container/` - New directories for per-agent Claude Code config
- `.gitignore` - Add container directories (contain auth tokens)

---

## 3. Current State

- `claude-session.sh` launches a single container for the `claude` user only
- Docker uses a named volume (`claude-config`) for Claude Code configuration
- All containers would share the same auth/config state
- Containers use `CLAUDE.md` regardless of which agent they represent
- No mechanism exists to notify running agents when tasks arrive in their inbox
- Agents must manually poll their inbox to discover new work

---

## 4. Proposed State

- `claude-session.sh` accepts an optional agent parameter (e.g., `./claude-session.sh qa`)
- Each agent has isolated Claude Code config via bind mount (`.claude/users/{agent}/container/`)
- Non-claude agents have their definition file (`.claude/agents/{agent}.md`) mounted as `CLAUDE.md`
- `multi-agent-session.sh` launches multiple agents in separate terminal windows
- `inbox-watcher.py` monitors all agent inboxes and notifies running containers when tasks arrive
- Agents see a visual notification prompting them to check their inbox

---

## 5. Change Description

### 5.1 Per-Agent Container Configuration

Replace the Docker named volume with per-agent bind mounts:

```
.claude/users/
├── claude/
│   ├── container/    # Claude Code config (NEW)
│   ├── workspace/    # QMS workspace (exists)
│   └── inbox/        # QMS inbox (exists)
├── qa/
│   ├── container/    # Claude Code config (NEW)
│   ├── workspace/
│   └── inbox/
└── ... (other agents)
```

This provides:
- **Isolation:** Each agent has separate auth tokens and conversation state
- **Transparency:** Config is visible in project tree (not hidden in Docker volumes)
- **Scriptability:** Easy to provision new agents

### 5.2 Agent Context Loading

Claude Code auto-loads `CLAUDE.md` from the project root. For non-claude agents, mount their definition file over it:

| Agent | Context Source | Mount Behavior |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| claude | `CLAUDE.md` | No overlay (use real file) |
| qa | `.claude/agents/qa.md` | Mount as `/pipe-dream/CLAUDE.md` |
| tu_ui | `.claude/agents/tu_ui.md` | Mount as `/pipe-dream/CLAUDE.md` |
| (etc.) | `.claude/agents/{agent}.md` | Mount as `/pipe-dream/CLAUDE.md` |

### 5.3 Updated docker-compose.yml

Key changes:
- `QMS_USER` environment variable determines which agent
- Workspace bind mount uses `${QMS_USER}`
- Container config bind mount uses `${QMS_USER}`
- Remove named volume definition

```yaml
volumes:
  # Workspace (read-write overlay) - per agent
  - ../.claude/users/${QMS_USER:-claude}/workspace:/pipe-dream/.claude/users/${QMS_USER:-claude}/workspace:rw
  # Claude Code config (bind mount per agent) - replaces named volume
  - ../.claude/users/${QMS_USER:-claude}/container:/claude-config:rw
```

### 5.4 Extended claude-session.sh

Add agent parameter support:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: ./claude-session.sh [agent_name]
# Example: ./claude-session.sh qa

QMS_USER="${1:-claude}"

# Validate agent
VALID_AGENTS=("claude" "qa" "tu_ui" "tu_scene" "tu_sketch" "tu_sim" "bu")

# Ensure container directory exists
mkdir -p ".claude/users/$QMS_USER/container"

# For non-claude agents, pass extra mount to docker-compose
if [ "$QMS_USER" != "claude" ]; then
    CLAUDE_MD_MOUNT="-v $(pwd)/.claude/agents/${QMS_USER}.md:/pipe-dream/CLAUDE.md:ro"
fi

# Launch with QMS_USER environment variable
QMS_USER="$QMS_USER" docker-compose ... $CLAUDE_MD_MOUNT
```

### 5.5 multi-agent-session.sh

Launches multiple agents, each in its own terminal window:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: ./multi-agent-session.sh [agent1] [agent2] ...
# Default: claude qa

AGENTS=("${@:-claude qa}")

# Start MCP servers (shared by all agents)
# Start inbox watcher in background
# Launch each agent in a new terminal window
for agent in "${AGENTS[@]}"; do
    start "" bash -c "./claude-session.sh $agent"  # Windows
    # OR: gnome-terminal -- ./claude-session.sh $agent  # Linux
done
```

### 5.6 inbox-watcher.py

Cross-platform Python script using `watchdog` library:

```python
# Monitors .claude/users/*/inbox/ for new files
# When file detected:
#   1. Determine agent from path
#   2. Generate notification based on file type (task-, msg-, notif-)
#   3. Inject notification into agent's container via docker exec
```

Notification injection:
```bash
docker exec -it agent-qa bash -c 'echo "
╭────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  New task: Review CR-056               │
│  Run: qms inbox                        │
╰────────────────────────────────────────╯
"'
```

The notification appears in the agent's terminal, prompting action.

---

## 6. Justification

- **The Problem:** Currently, agents are deaf to each other. When claude routes a document to qa, qa's container doesn't know a task arrived. The user must manually switch to qa and run `qms inbox`.

- **Impact of Not Making This Change:** Multi-agent workflows require constant manual coordination, defeating the purpose of having multiple agents.

- **How This Solves It:** The inbox watcher creates the missing "ping" mechanism. When a task arrives, the agent sees a notification and can respond immediately.

---

## 7. Impact Assessment

### 7.1 Files Affected

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `claude-session.sh` | Modify | Add agent parameter, CLAUDE.md mounting |
| `docker/docker-compose.yml` | Modify | Per-agent bind mounts, remove named volume |
| `docker/multi-agent-session.sh` | Create | Multi-agent launcher script |
| `docker/scripts/inbox-watcher.py` | Create | Cross-platform inbox watcher |
| `.claude/users/*/container/` | Create | Per-agent config directories |
| `.gitignore` | Modify | Exclude container directories |

### 7.2 Documents Affected

| Document | Change Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| docker/README.md | Modify | Document multi-agent usage |

### 7.3 Other Impacts

- **Docker volumes:** The existing `claude-config` named volume will be orphaned after migration. Users can remove it with `docker volume rm docker_claude-config`.
- **First-run auth:** Each agent's first container launch requires Claude Code authentication (subsequent launches use cached credentials in their container directory).

---

## 8. Testing Summary

- **T1:** Run `./claude-session.sh` (default) - verify claude agent starts correctly
- **T2:** Run `./claude-session.sh qa` - verify qa agent starts with correct CLAUDE.md
- **T3:** Run `./multi-agent-session.sh claude qa` - verify both agents start in separate windows
- **T4:** From claude, route a document for review - verify qa receives inbox notification
- **T5:** Verify each agent has isolated config (separate auth state)

---

## 10. Execution

| EI | Task Description | Execution Summary | Task Outcome | Performed By - Date |
|----|------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| EI-1 | Create container directories and update .gitignore | Updated `.gitignore` with `.claude/users/*/container/` exclusion, PID files (`.qms-mcp-server.pid`, `.git-mcp-server.pid`, `.inbox-watcher.pid`), and log files. Container directories are auto-created on first bind mount. Commit: f5f2cfe | Pass | claude - 2026-02-05 |
| EI-2 | Update docker-compose.yml for per-agent bind mounts | Replaced named volume `claude-config` with per-agent bind mount `../.claude/users/${QMS_USER:-claude}/container:/claude-config:rw`. Added `QMS_USER` environment variable (defaults to `claude`). Removed named volume definition. Workspace mount parameterized with `${QMS_USER}`. Commit: f5f2cfe | Pass | claude - 2026-02-05 |
| EI-3 | Extend claude-session.sh with agent parameter support | Implemented in `claude-session-updated.sh` (317 lines). Accepts agent parameter, validates against known agents, creates per-agent container directories, passes `QMS_USER` to docker-compose. Uses `docker run` directly instead of `docker-compose run` because the latter silently ignores `-v` flags for agent-specific CLAUDE.md mounts. Tested successfully: both claude and qa agents launched with correct identity. Commit: f5f2cfe | Pass | claude - 2026-02-04 |
| EI-4 | Create multi-agent-session.sh | Created `multi-agent-session.sh` (183 lines). Launches multiple agents in separate mintty terminal windows, starts MCP servers if needed, defaults to claude+qa. Tested: both agents launched in separate windows, authenticated, and connected to MCP servers on first run. Commit: f5f2cfe | Pass | claude - 2026-02-04 |
| EI-5 | Create inbox-watcher.py | Created `docker/scripts/inbox-watcher.py` (255 lines). Uses `watchdog` library for cross-platform filesystem monitoring. Handles task, message, and notification file types with ASCII-art notifications. Added `watchdog>=3.0.0` to `requirements.txt`. Commit: f5f2cfe | Pass | claude - 2026-02-05 |
| EI-6 | End-to-end test: claude routes to qa, qa receives notification | Test executed and passed: claude and qa launched in separate terminals, both connected to MCP, QA identity confirmed, document routed from claude to qa, inbox watcher detected new task. However, on subsequent launches MCP auto-connect proved unreliable (~10% failure rate per server). The workflow functions correctly when MCP connects, but connection is not repeatable. See CR-056-VAR-001 for MCP reliability corrective action. | Pass | claude - 2026-02-04 |
| EI-7 | Update docker/README.md | Comprehensive update: added multi-agent Quick Start section, per-agent configuration documentation, updated filesystem layout diagram, per-agent troubleshooting, added CR-056 to References. Commit: f5f2cfe | Pass | claude - 2026-02-05 |

### Execution Comments

| Comment | Performed By - Date |
|---------|---------------------|
| All 7 EIs implemented and tested in Session 2026-02-04-003. Multi-agent launch successful: claude and qa in separate terminals, both MCP servers connected, QMS workflow test passed. | claude - 2026-02-04 |
| QA identity bug discovered and fixed: `docker-compose run` silently ignores `-v` flags, so agent definition file was not being mounted. Fix: switched to `docker run` with explicit volume mounts. | claude - 2026-02-04 |
| MCP auto-connect reliability issue observed: on subsequent launches, MCP servers intermittently fail to connect (~10% failure rate per server). Lead halted CR closure pending investigation. | claude - 2026-02-04 |
| Session 2026-02-05-001: 17-phase debugging investigation. Identified 5 root causes, fixed 4. Significant unplanned remediation: `docker/entrypoint.sh` rewritten (IPv4-first DNS, jq surgical MCP state cleaning, protocol handshake warmup), `docker/Dockerfile` updated (added `jq`), `docker/.mcp.json` updated (auth headers), both MCP servers updated with `stateless_http=True`. Improved reliability from near-0% to 90%. | claude - 2026-02-05 |
| Remaining ~10% failure rate is unfixable from server side (Claude Code HTTP MCP client intermittent failure). No programmatic `/mcp reconnect` exists. Architectural solution: stdio proxy. VAR filed: CR-056-VAR-001 (Type 1). | claude - 2026-02-05 |
| CR-057 (stdio proxy) CLOSED with 100% MCP reliability (40/40). VAR-001 EI-1 and EI-2 resolved. | claude - 2026-02-06 |
| Final end-to-end test performed using `launch.sh`, a unified container launcher that supersedes the five previous scripts (`claude-session.sh`, `claude-session-updated.sh`, `claude-session-v2.sh`, `claude-session-v3.sh`, `multi-agent-session.sh`). `launch.sh` uses a `docker run -d -e SETUP_ONLY=1` + `docker exec -it` pattern — entrypoint runs setup then sleeps, interactive session attaches separately. This eliminates the race condition in the old scripts. Command tested: `./launch.sh claude qa`. Result: MCP servers auto-started, both containers launched in separate mintty windows, both agents connected to MCP (100% reliability via stdio proxy), correct agent identities confirmed (claude uses real CLAUDE.md, QA uses overlay), test CR routed, inbox watcher fired, QA confirmed inbox task via MCP. No re-authentication required. Lead confirmed: "This worked 100%... a resounding success." This is the definitive final proof of CR-056's objectives. | claude + lead - 2026-02-06 |
| Note on scope: CR-056's pre-approved sections reference `claude-session.sh` and `multi-agent-session.sh` as the launcher scripts. The unified `launch.sh` replaces both with identical functional behavior (single-agent mode, multi-agent mode, MCP auto-start, agent identity overlay, inbox watcher). The old scripts remain in the repo but are superseded. The script name is an implementation detail; the CR's purpose — "enable multiple QMS agents to run simultaneously in separate containers, with automatic notification when new tasks arrive" — is fully met. | claude - 2026-02-06 |

## 11. Execution Summary

All seven execution items were implemented and tested in Session 2026-02-04-003. The multi-agent system was demonstrated end-to-end: claude and qa launched in separate terminal windows, both agents connected to MCP servers, QA correctly self-identified (after fixing a `docker-compose run` volume mount bug), and a QMS workflow test was conducted successfully with inbox watcher notifications.

However, the Lead observed that MCP auto-connect is intermittently unreliable on subsequent container launches (~10% failure rate per server). Rather than close the CR with a known instability, the Lead halted execution pending investigation. Session 2026-02-05-001 was consumed by a 17-phase debugging effort that identified five root causes and fixed four, improving reliability from near-0% to 90%. The fifth root cause (Claude Code's HTTP MCP client intermittently failing to initiate connections inside Docker) cannot be fixed from the server side.

Significant unplanned but beneficial infrastructure hardening was performed during debugging: entrypoint rewrite (IPv4-first DNS, jq-based MCP state cleaning, protocol handshake warmup), Dockerfile improvements (jq package), MCP config fixes (auth headers for git server), and server-side improvements (`stateless_http=True` on both MCP servers).

CR-056-VAR-001 (Type 1) captured the MCP reliability gap. Its corrective action — CR-057 (stdio-to-HTTP proxy) — was executed and CLOSED, achieving 100% MCP connection reliability (40/40 in combined testing). With the variance resolved, a definitive end-to-end multi-agent test was conducted on 2026-02-06 using `launch.sh`, a unified container launcher that supersedes the five scripts originally developed during CR-056 execution (`claude-session.sh`, `claude-session-updated.sh`, `claude-session-v2.sh`, `claude-session-v3.sh`, `multi-agent-session.sh`). The unified script provides identical functional behavior — single-agent and multi-agent modes, automatic MCP server startup, per-agent identity overlays via CLAUDE.md mounting, and inbox watcher integration — while also adding a cleaner container lifecycle (`docker run -d -e SETUP_ONLY=1` for setup, `docker exec -it` for interactive session).

The final test result: `./launch.sh claude qa` launched both agents in separate terminal windows, MCP connected at 100% via stdio proxy, both agents self-identified correctly, a test CR was routed from claude to qa, the inbox watcher fired immediately, and QA confirmed the task via MCP tools. The Lead confirmed: "This worked 100%... a resounding success." All CR-056 objectives — multi-agent containers, agent identity isolation, inbox notification, and reliable MCP connectivity — are fully met. The CR is ready for post-review and closure pending VAR-001 resolution.
