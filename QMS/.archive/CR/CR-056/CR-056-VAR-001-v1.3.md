## 2. Detailed Description

CR-056 implements multi-agent container session infrastructure. All seven execution items were implemented and tested in Session 2026-02-04-003. The multi-agent system was demonstrated end-to-end: claude and qa launched in separate terminal windows, both connected to MCP servers, QA correctly self-identified (after fixing a volume mount bug), and a QMS workflow test passed with inbox watcher notifications.

However, the Lead observed that on subsequent container launches, MCP auto-connect is intermittently unreliable. The end-to-end test (EI-6) passed on its initial run but is not repeatable — the multi-agent workflow cannot be relied upon for production use.

**Expected:** Claude Code auto-connects to MCP servers via HTTP transport on every container startup, making the multi-agent workflow repeatable.

**Actual:** MCP servers fail to auto-connect approximately 10% of the time. Failures are per-server and independent. In some cases, Claude Code does not even attempt an HTTP connection to the server (no requests observed in server logs). Manual `/mcp` reconnect always works, but no programmatic reconnection mechanism exists. The Lead correctly halted CR-056 closure rather than accept a non-repeatable result.

---

## 3. Root Cause

Five root causes were identified during a 17-phase debugging effort (Session-2026-02-05-001):

1. **Stale MCP Session ID Reuse** (server-side) — Claude Code caches `Mcp-Session-Id` headers; server evicts the session; client doesn't recover. **Fixed** with `stateless_http=True` on both MCP servers.

2. **406 Accept Header Rejection** (protocol mismatch) — Claude Code sends HTTP requests without proper `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` header. MCP SDK rejects with 406. **Partially mitigated** by `stateless_http=True`; ASGI middleware that attempted to fix headers made things worse.

3. **Accumulated Client State** (client-side) — MCP-related fields in `.claude.json` accumulate across container runs, causing stale state. **Fixed** with surgical `jq` cleaning in entrypoint.

4. **IPv6/IPv4 Dual-Stack** (network) — Node.js resolves `host.docker.internal` to IPv6 first, which is unreachable in Docker. **Fixed** with `NODE_OPTIONS="--dns-result-order=ipv4first"`.

5. **Claude Code HTTP MCP Client Intermittent Failure** (client-side, **UNFIXABLE from server side**) — Claude Code sometimes does not attempt to connect at all. No server-side logs, no requests, no errors. This is an internal timeout or race condition in Claude Code's MCP client initialization. No programmatic `/mcp reconnect` exists. Confirmed by multiple open GitHub issues (#15232, #1026, #10129, #10071) with no timeline for resolution.

Root causes 1-4 were resolved, bringing reliability from near-0% to 90% (27/30 in best trial). Root cause 5 accounts for the remaining ~10% and cannot be fixed from the server side.

---

## 4. Variance Type

External Factor — The root cause is an intermittent failure in Claude Code's HTTP MCP client when running inside Docker containers. This is a limitation of the external tool (Claude Code) that cannot be resolved through server-side changes or configuration. The execution plan assumed HTTP MCP connections would work reliably, which proved false under repeated testing.

## 5. Impact Assessment

**Effect on parent objectives:** CR-056's core goal — multi-agent container sessions with inbox notifications — has been fully implemented and demonstrated. All seven EIs pass. However, the system depends on MCP auto-connect, which is unreliable. The multi-agent workflow works when MCP connects but cannot be relied upon for repeatable production use.

**What was accomplished in the parent:**
- All 7 EIs implemented and tested (Session 2026-02-04-003)
- Multi-agent launch demonstrated (claude + qa in separate terminals)
- QA identity bug found and fixed (docker-compose run `-v` issue)
- QMS workflow test passed (document routed, inbox watcher notified)
- Significant unplanned hardening during debugging: entrypoint rewrite, Dockerfile improvements, MCP server `stateless_http=True`, auth header fixes

**What this VAR absorbs:**
- The gap between "works" and "works reliably every time"
- Specifically: MCP auto-connect must be made near-100% reliable before the CR can close

**No scope items are lost.** All EIs are complete. The VAR addresses the underlying reliability of the infrastructure they depend on.

## 6. Proposed Resolution

### Corrective Action: Stdio Proxy CR

Create a new Change Record to implement a **stdio-to-HTTP proxy** inside the container, eliminating HTTP transport from Claude Code's perspective entirely.

**Architecture:**
```
Claude Code <--stdio--> mcp_proxy.py <--HTTP--> Host MCP Server
```

- **Claude Code to Proxy:** stdio transport (local subprocess, near-100% reliable)
- **Proxy to Host Server:** HTTP with retry logic (proxy handles failures transparently)
- Claude Code never sees HTTP. It only sees a local stdio MCP server that always responds.

**Why this resolves the variance:**
- Stdio MCP connections are local subprocess spawns — no network, no Docker virtual networking, no HTTP client issues
- The proxy handles HTTP connection management with configurable retry logic
- If the HTTP connection to the host fails, the proxy retries before returning an error
- Claude Code sees a clean MCP error (not a connection failure) if all retries are exhausted

**Implementation plan:** Documented in `Session-2026-02-05-001/stdio-proxy-plan.md`.

**After the stdio proxy CR is closed:**
- MCP auto-connect reliability validated at 30/30 (target: 100%)
- CR-056 EI-6 end-to-end test re-run to confirm repeatable multi-agent workflow

### Resolution: CR-056

| EI | Task Description | Execution Summary | Task Outcome | Performed By - Date |
|----|------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| EI-1 | Create and execute CR for stdio proxy implementation | CR-057 created, reviewed, approved, executed (7 EIs all Pass), post-reviewed, post-approved, and CLOSED. Proxy replaces HTTP with stdio transport, achieving 100% MCP connection reliability. | Pass | claude - 2026-02-06 |
| EI-2 | Validate MCP auto-connect reliability with stdio proxy (target: 30/30) | Validated as part of CR-057 EI-5. Option B (scripted): 30/30 passes. Option A (full-stack): 10/10 passes. Combined: 40/40 (100%), up from 27/30 (90%) with HTTP. | Pass | claude + lead - 2026-02-06 |
| EI-3 | Re-run CR-056 EI-6 end-to-end test with reliable MCP connections | End-to-end test performed using `launch.sh`, the unified container launcher that supersedes the scripts named in CR-056's pre-approved scope. The naming deviation is formally authorized by CR-056-VAR-002 (CLOSED) — QA reviewed, approved, and confirmed that `launch.sh` satisfies every functional requirement from the pre-approved scope. Command: `./launch.sh claude qa`. Results: MCP servers auto-started, Docker image detected, both containers launched in separate mintty windows, both agents connected to MCP via stdio proxy (100% connect, no retries needed), claude correctly self-identified, QA correctly self-identified with agent overlay CLAUDE.md, test CR created and routed for review from claude's terminal, inbox watcher fired (detected new inbox file in its monitoring terminal), QA confirmed task via `qms_inbox` MCP tool. No re-authentication required. Lead performed a second end-to-end test after VAR-002 execution (deletion of obsolete scripts) — identical success. All CR-056 objectives met with full reliability. | Pass | claude + lead - 2026-02-06 |

### Resolution Comments

| Comment | Performed By - Date |
|---------|---------------------|
| CR-057 CLOSED. EI-1 and EI-2 of this VAR are satisfied by CR-057's execution results. EI-3 (end-to-end multi-agent test) remains. | claude - 2026-02-06 |
| EI-3 end-to-end test was performed using `launch.sh`, a unified container launcher that replaces the five overlapping scripts (`claude-session.sh`, `claude-session-updated.sh`, `claude-session-v2.sh`, `claude-session-v3.sh`, `multi-agent-session.sh`). The new script uses a `docker run -d -e SETUP_ONLY=1` + `docker exec -it` pattern that cleanly separates entrypoint setup from interactive session attachment. The test was a complete success — 100% MCP reliability via stdio proxy, correct agent identities, inbox watcher functioning, QMS workflow passing end-to-end. Lead confirmed result directly. | claude - 2026-02-06 |
| The use of `launch.sh` as the test vehicle (rather than the scripts named in CR-056's pre-approved scope) is formally authorized by CR-056-VAR-002 (CLOSED). VAR-002 was QA-reviewed and QA-approved through both pre- and post-approval cycles, confirming that `launch.sh` satisfies the intent of the pre-approved scope. The obsolete scripts were deleted as part of VAR-002 EI-1, and Lead performed a successful end-to-end test after deletion (VAR-002 EI-2). `launch.sh` is therefore the authorized, QA-approved final product of CR-056's launcher infrastructure. | claude - 2026-02-06 |

## 8. VAR Closure

| Details of Resolution | Outcome | Performed By - Date |
|-----------------------|---------|---------------------|
| All three resolution EIs pass. CR-057 (stdio proxy) achieved 100% MCP reliability (40/40). The definitive end-to-end multi-agent test was performed using `launch.sh` — a unified launcher that supersedes the original scripts referenced in CR-056's pre-approved scope. Both claude and qa agents launched in separate containers, self-identified correctly, connected to MCP without failure, and completed a full QMS workflow (create CR, route for review, inbox watcher detected new file, QA confirmed task via MCP). The variance — that multi-agent sessions were not repeatable due to MCP unreliability — is fully resolved. The intent of CR-056 EI-6 is satisfied. The use of `launch.sh` (rather than the scripts named in the pre-approved scope) is formally authorized by CR-056-VAR-002 (CLOSED) — QA reviewed and approved the naming deviation through both pre- and post-approval cycles, confirming that `launch.sh` satisfies every functional requirement. The obsolete scripts were deleted as part of VAR-002 execution, and Lead verified `launch.sh` still works after deletion. | Resolved | claude + lead - 2026-02-06 |
