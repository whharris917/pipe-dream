## 2. Detailed Description

During CR-036 execution (EI-10: README update), a comprehensive audit of seed documents revealed two categories of issues:

### Issue Category 1: Documentation Drift

Significant discrepancies exist between the qualified code/RS and the production pipe-dream documentation:

| Document | Issue |
|----------|-------|
| README.md | User Groups table incorrect; non-existent doc types (CAPA, OQ, CS, DS) referenced; hardcoded project-specific usernames |
| SOP-001.md | Section 4 User Groups doesn't match code; directory structure shows non-generic usernames; Document Naming Convention includes non-existent types |
| SOP-006.md | References to OQ/CS/DS document types that don't exist |
| SOP-007.md | Hardcoded usernames instead of generic role descriptions |
| Agent files | May lack proper `group:` frontmatter for permission system |

These issues were fixed in the qms-cli dev branch seed documents (so new projects get consistent documentation), but the production pipe-dream documents still contain the discrepancies.

### Issue Category 2: Qualification Gap

REQ-SEC-002 specifies that the `fix` command is available to the `administrator` group. However:

1. The code uses hardcoded username checks (`{"qa", "lead"}`) instead of group membership
2. The qualification test `test_fix_authorization` verifies code behavior rather than RS requirements
3. Qualification was allowed to proceed despite this gap

The test passes because it tests what the code does, not what the RS says it should do. This represents a systematic gap in qualification verification.

---

## 3. Root Cause

**Documentation Drift:** Documents evolved independently of the code without systematic consistency checks. No process existed to verify documentation alignment with qualified code/RS.

**Qualification Gap:** The test author verified implementation rather than requirements. Review did not catch that the test methodology was backwards (testing code → requirement satisfaction rather than requirement → code verification).

---

## 4. Variance Type

Other: Combination of Documentation Error (documentation doesn't match code) and Scope Error (qualification test design methodology was incorrect).

Select one:
- Execution Error: Executor made a mistake or didn't follow instructions
- Scope Error: Plan/scope was written or designed incorrectly
- System Error: The system behaved unexpectedly
- Documentation Error: Error in a document other than the parent
- External Factor: Environmental or external issue
- Other: See Detailed Description

## 5. Impact Assessment

**On CR-036:** CR-036's core objectives (initialization/bootstrapping) are not affected. The issues were discovered during CR-036 work but are not caused by CR-036.

**On pipe-dream:** Production documentation is inconsistent with the qualified system. Users reading SOPs may have incorrect understanding of system behavior.

**On QMS integrity:** A requirement (REQ-SEC-002) was marked as verified despite the verification being inadequate. This indicates a gap in the qualification review process.

---

## 6. Proposed Resolution

Two corrective actions are required:

### Corrective Action 1: Documentation Alignment CR

Create, execute, and close a Change Record to fix documentation drift in production pipe-dream:
- Update README.md
- Update SOP-001.md
- Update SOP-006.md
- Update SOP-007.md
- Add `group:` frontmatter to agent files (qa, bu, tu_ui, tu_scene, tu_sketch, tu_sim)

A draft scope document has been created: `CR-037-DRAFT-SCOPE.md` in the qms-cli dev branch.

### Corrective Action 2: Investigation into Qualification Gap

Create, execute, and close an Investigation to determine:
- How did REQ-SEC-002 pass qualification with an incorrect test?
- What review process gaps allowed this?
- What preventive actions should be implemented?

### Resolution: CR-036

| EI | Task Description | Execution Summary | Task Outcome | Performed By - Date |
|----|------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| EI-1 | Create, execute, and close CR for documentation alignment in pipe-dream | [SUMMARY] | [Pass/Fail] | [PERFORMER] - [DATE] |
| EI-2 | Create, execute, and close INV for qualification gap analysis | [SUMMARY] | [Pass/Fail] | [PERFORMER] - [DATE] |

### Resolution Comments

| Comment | Performed By - Date |
|---------|---------------------|
| Seed documents in qms-cli dev branch have already been fixed (commit 256820b). This VAR tracks the corrective work needed in production pipe-dream. | claude - 2026-01-25 |
