# CR-080: Terminal Scrollback Support in Agent GUI

## 1. Purpose

Enable users to scroll through terminal history in the Agent Hub GUI's xterm.js terminals. During Phase A.4 integration testing, terminal scrollback was identified as a usability gap — users cannot review previous output by scrolling up.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

Gap discovered during Phase A.4 integration testing (Session-2026-02-14-002). Tracked in PROJECT_STATE.md backlog under "GUI Polish."

- **Parent Document:** None

### 2.2 Changes Summary

Investigate and fix terminal scrollback in the xterm.js-based agent terminals. The scrollback buffer is already configured (`scrollback: 10000`), so the issue likely involves event handling, CSS, or Tauri webview interaction preventing mouse wheel scroll from reaching xterm.js.

### 2.3 Files Affected

- `agent-hub/gui/src/components/Terminal/TerminalView.tsx` - Potential scroll event or configuration fixes
- `agent-hub/gui/src/styles/global.css` - Potential CSS fixes for terminal container scrolling

---

## 3. Current State

The xterm.js terminal instances are configured with `scrollback: 10000` lines of buffer. However, users cannot scroll through terminal history to review previous output. The terminal container uses absolute positioning with `inset: 0` and `padding: 4px`.

---

## 4. Proposed State

Users can scroll through terminal history using the mouse wheel (and optionally keyboard shortcuts like Shift+PageUp/PageDown). Scrollback behavior works naturally within the xterm.js terminal viewport.

---

## 5. Change Description

### 5.1 Diagnosis

Identify what prevents scrolling from working. Likely candidates:

1. **CSS overflow:** The terminal container or its parent may have `overflow: hidden` preventing scroll events from reaching xterm.js
2. **Event interception:** The Tauri webview or a parent element may be consuming wheel events before xterm.js receives them
3. **xterm.js addon conflict:** The FitAddon's ResizeObserver may interfere with scroll behavior

### 5.2 Fix

Apply the minimum fix required based on diagnosis. This may involve:

- Adjusting CSS overflow properties on the terminal container
- Ensuring wheel events propagate to xterm.js
- Adding any missing xterm.js configuration

The fix scope is intentionally narrow — diagnose the specific blocker and resolve it.

---

## 6. Justification

- Terminal scrollback is a fundamental usability requirement for any terminal interface. Without it, users lose access to output that scrolls past the viewport.
- Agent sessions produce substantial output (Claude Code conversations, build output, test results). Reviewing this output is essential for monitoring agent behavior.
- The scrollback buffer is already allocated (10,000 lines) but inaccessible to the user, meaning the memory cost is already paid with no benefit.

## 7. Impact Assessment

### 7.1 Files Affected

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `agent-hub/gui/src/components/Terminal/TerminalView.tsx` | Modify | Scroll event handling or configuration |
| `agent-hub/gui/src/styles/global.css` | Modify | CSS adjustments if overflow is the blocker |

### 7.2 Documents Affected

| Document | Change Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| None | - | No controlled documents affected |

### 7.3 Other Impacts

None. This is a client-side GUI fix with no backend, protocol, or infrastructure changes.

---

## 8. Testing Summary

- Manual verification: launch an agent in the GUI, generate sufficient output to exceed the viewport, and confirm mouse wheel scrolling works to review previous output
- Verify that scrolling does not interfere with normal terminal input when at the bottom of the buffer
- Verify terminal resizing (via window resize or tab switching) still works correctly after the fix

---

## 9. Implementation Plan

### 9.1 Diagnosis

1. Launch the Agent Hub GUI with an active agent
2. Generate terminal output exceeding the viewport
3. Test mouse wheel scrolling — confirm the failure mode
4. Inspect DOM/CSS for overflow or event issues
5. Identify root cause

### 9.2 Implementation

1. Apply the minimum fix based on diagnosis
2. Test scrollback behavior manually
3. Verify no regression in terminal resize, tab switching, or input handling

### 9.3 Integration

1. Commit the fix
2. Document evidence in CR
