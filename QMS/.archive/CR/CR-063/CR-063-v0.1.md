# CR-063: Remove PID files — port-based process discovery

## 1. Purpose

Eliminate PID files (`.qms-mcp-server.pid`, `.git-mcp-server.pid`, `.agent-hub.pid`) from the Pipe Dream service lifecycle. These files are unreliable for their sole purpose (identifying processes to kill) and introduce a class of stale-state warnings that disappear entirely when the files don't exist. Additionally, remove legacy files (`.mcp-server.pid`, `.mcp-server.log`) left over from earlier infrastructure iterations.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

Follow-on from CR-062 (`pd-status` utility). During CR-062 implementation, all three PID files were found stale — services had been restarted with new PIDs but the files still referenced dead processes. Analysis showed PID files are referenced in exactly two places: `launch.sh` writes them, and `launch.sh` prints a `kill $(cat ...)` command at session end. Nothing uses them for health checking or service discovery.

- **Parent Document:** CR-062

### 2.2 Changes Summary

Remove PID file writes from `launch.sh`, remove PID file reads from `pd-status`, and replace `--stop-all` with port-based process discovery using PowerShell (`Get-NetTCPConnection`) on Windows and `lsof`/`ss` on Linux/Mac.

### 2.3 Files Affected

- `launch.sh` — Remove PID file writes, update post-session message
- `pd-status` — Remove PID file reads, implement port-based `--stop-all`
- `.gitignore` — Remove PID file entries (if present)
- `.mcp-server.pid` — Delete legacy file
- `.mcp-server.log` — Delete legacy file

---

## 3. Current State

`launch.sh` writes three PID files when starting services. These go stale when services are restarted outside `launch.sh` (manually, via `docker/scripts/`, or after a crash). `pd-status` reads PID files, cross-references them against port probes, and flags mismatches as warnings. `pd-status --stop-all` reads PID files to find processes to kill — if PIDs are stale, it cannot kill the actual services.

---

## 4. Proposed State

No PID files are written or read. `pd-status` uses only port probing (curl) for status detection. `pd-status --stop-all` finds the owning process for each port via OS-native tools and kills it directly. `launch.sh` post-session message references `./pd-status --stop-all` instead of a manual `kill` command.

---

## 5. Change Description

### 5.1 `launch.sh` Changes

1. **Remove PID writes** in `ensure_mcp_servers()` (lines 69, 89) and `ensure_hub()` (line 258):
   - Delete `echo $! > "$SCRIPT_DIR/.qms-mcp-server.pid"`
   - Delete `echo $! > "$SCRIPT_DIR/.git-mcp-server.pid"`
   - Delete `echo $! > "$SCRIPT_DIR/.agent-hub.pid"`

2. **Update post-session messages** (lines 336, 347):
   - Replace `kill $(cat .agent-hub.pid) $(cat .qms-mcp-server.pid) $(cat .git-mcp-server.pid)` with `./pd-status --stop-all`

### 5.2 `pd-status` Changes

1. **Remove PID file reading** from `show_status()`:
   - Remove all `.pid` file reads, `pid_alive()` checks, and stale PID warnings
   - Simplify service status to: port responding = RUNNING, not responding = STOPPED
   - Remove the `pid_alive()` helper function entirely
   - Remove legacy `.mcp-server.pid` warning

2. **Replace `--stop-all` process discovery** with port-based approach:
   - On Windows (Git Bash): Use `powershell.exe -Command "Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort PORT -State Listen"` to find the owning PID, then `taskkill.exe //PID N //F` to kill it
   - On Linux/Mac: Use `lsof -ti :PORT` or `ss -tlnp` to find the owning PID, then `kill PID`
   - Add a `find_pid_on_port()` helper that abstracts the OS-specific lookup

3. **Simplify warnings section**: With no PID files to go stale, the entire stale-PID warning category disappears. The Warnings section only appears if there's something else to report (e.g., a service that can't be killed).

### 5.3 Cleanup

1. Delete any existing `.pid` files from the working directory (not tracked by git, but present on disk)
2. Delete legacy `.mcp-server.log` from the working directory
3. Remove PID file entries from `.gitignore` if present

---

## 6. Justification

- PID files are unreliable — they go stale whenever services are restarted outside `launch.sh`, which is the common case
- `pd-status --stop-all` cannot fulfill its purpose when PID files are stale (it can't kill the actual services)
- Port-based discovery is strictly more reliable: it finds the process actually holding the port, regardless of how it was started
- Removing PID files eliminates an entire class of warnings from `pd-status` output, reducing noise
- The `launch.sh` post-session `kill` command already fails silently with stale PIDs — replacing it with `./pd-status --stop-all` gives users a reliable cleanup path

## 7. Impact Assessment

### 7.1 Files Affected

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `launch.sh` | Modify | Remove PID file writes (3 locations), update post-session message |
| `pd-status` | Modify | Remove PID file reads, port-based `--stop-all` |

### 7.2 Documents Affected

| Document | Change Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| CR-063 | Create | This Change Record |

### 7.3 Other Impacts

None. PID files are not referenced by any other scripts, Docker configurations, or documentation. The `docker/scripts/start-mcp-server.sh` and `start-git-mcp.sh` scripts do not write or read PID files.

---

## 8. Testing Summary

- Run `./pd-status` after changes — services show RUNNING/STOPPED based on port probes only, no PID info, no stale warnings
- Run `./pd-status --stop-all` with all 3 services running — verify each is killed by port-based PID lookup
- Re-run `./pd-status` after stop-all — verify all show STOPPED
- Run `launch.sh` single-agent flow — verify no PID files are created, post-session message references `pd-status --stop-all`
- Verify no `.pid` files remain in project root after a full start/stop cycle

---

## 9. Implementation Plan

### 9.1 Phase 1: Modify `pd-status`

1. Add `find_pid_on_port()` helper (Windows: PowerShell, Linux/Mac: lsof/ss)
2. Remove `pid_alive()` helper
3. Simplify `show_status()` to port-probe-only detection
4. Rewrite `stop_all()` to use `find_pid_on_port()` instead of PID file reads
5. Remove all PID file references and stale-PID warning logic
6. Test `--stop-all` kills services reliably

### 9.2 Phase 2: Modify `launch.sh`

1. Remove PID file writes from `ensure_mcp_servers()` and `ensure_hub()`
2. Update post-session messages to reference `./pd-status --stop-all`
3. Test full launch cycle produces no PID files

### 9.3 Phase 3: Cleanup

1. Delete existing `.pid` files from working directory
2. Delete legacy `.mcp-server.log` from working directory
3. Verify `.gitignore` (remove PID entries if present)
