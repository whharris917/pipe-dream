# CR-007: SOP-002 ID Reuse Policy Clarification

## 1. Purpose

Clarify the CR ID reuse policy in SOP-002 Section 5 to resolve an apparent conflict with SOP-001 Section 9.7.1 (Cancel workflow).

---

## 2. Scope

This change affects:
- **SOP-002** Section 5 (CR Numbering)

---

## 3. Rationale

**Current State (Conflict):**

SOP-002 Section 5 states:
> "Numbers are assigned in order of creation and are never reused."

SOP-001 Section 9.7.1 (Cancel) states:
> "Document ID is freed for reuse"

These statements conflict. A canceled document (never-effective, v < 1.0) should allow ID reuse, while closed/retired documents should not.

**Proposed Clarification:**

CR IDs are never reused for documents that have completed their workflow (closed/retired). However, IDs for canceled documents (never-effective) are freed for reuse.

**Background:** INV-001 identified this as a scope deviation in CR-005's execution.
