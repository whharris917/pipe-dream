# CR-094-ADD-001: CR-094 EI-12 Missing Verification Record

## 1. Addendum Identification

| Parent Document | Discovery Context | ADD Scope |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| CR-094 | Post-closure review of EI table | Create the VR required by CR-094 EI-12 |

---

## 2. Description of Omission

CR-094 EI-12 ("Recompile CR-092-VR-001") has "Yes" in its VR column, indicating that a Verification Record is required per SOP-004 Section 9C. During execution, the recompilation was performed and the results were documented in the EI execution summary, but no formal VR document was created.

Per SOP-004 Section 9C.3: "During execution, the initiator creates a VR as a child of the parent document. The VR ID is recorded in the VR column of the EI table (replacing 'Yes')." This step was not performed — the VR column still reads "Yes" rather than a VR document ID.

The verification work itself was done (CR-092-VR-001 was recompiled and all six acceptance criteria confirmed), but the evidence was recorded only in the EI execution summary rather than in a formal VR.

---

## 3. Impact Assessment

- **Parent objectives:** CR-094's core objectives (fix D1-D4 defects) were fully met. The recompilation confirmed all fixes work correctly.
- **Evidence gap:** The informal evidence in EI-12's execution summary is substantively complete but lacks the structured VR format required by SOP-004.
- **Downstream impact:** None. The defect fixes are merged and working. The gap is purely documentary.
- **QA post-review:** SOP-002 Section 7.3 item 6 requires "All VR-flagged execution items have an attached VR that is checked in." This condition was not verified during CR-094's post-review.

## 4. Correction Plan

Create the missing VR and record its ID.

| EI | Task Description |
|----|------------------|
| EI-1 | Create CR-094-ADD-001-VR-001 documenting the EI-12 recompilation verification |

---

## 5. Execution

| EI | Task Description | VR | Execution Summary | Task Outcome | Performed By — Date |
|----|------------------|----|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| EI-1 | Create CR-094-ADD-001-VR-001 documenting the EI-12 recompilation verification | CR-094-ADD-001-VR-001 | VR created via interactive authoring. Compiled CR-092-VR-001 output verified against all four defect fixes (D1-D4). Overall outcome: Pass. Evidence commit: 0282a83. | Pass | claude — 2026-02-21 |

-->

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| What the parent accomplished | CR-094 fixed four compilation defects (D1-D4), merged to qms-cli main at qualified commit c676b61 (643 tests), RS v17.0 and RTM v21.0 EFFECTIVE. EI-12 recompilation was performed and verified informally. |
| What this ADD corrects or supplements | Creates the formal VR document that EI-12's "Yes" VR column required but was never produced. |
| Confirmation no scope items were lost | Yes — all CR-094 scope items were completed. This ADD addresses only the missing documentary artifact. |

CR-094-ADD-001-VR-001 created and checked in with structured evidence confirming all four CR-094 defect fixes (D1-D4) produce correct output when recompiling CR-092-VR-001. The VR that CR-094 EI-12 required now exists as a formal document.
