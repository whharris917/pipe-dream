# CR-033: Relax CR ID requirement in revision_summary

## 1. Purpose

This CR relaxes the requirement that the `revision_summary` frontmatter field must begin with an authorizing CR ID. The current requirement is overly prescriptive and creates awkward situations where documents must reference themselves or where updates do not naturally stem from a CR.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

Independent improvement identified during development. The current requirement causes friction in several scenarios:
- CRs themselves (self-authorizing documents)
- Initial document creation (already exempted, but inconsistently)
- Documents updated through workflows that don't naturally map to a single CR

- **Parent Document:** None

### 2.2 Changes Summary

Change the `revision_summary` CR ID reference from a hard requirement to a guideline: reference a CR *if* the update was driven by a CR. Remove enforcement from review prompts and agent definitions.

### 2.3 Files Affected

- `QMS/SOP/SOP-001.md` - Update Section 5.1 to make CR ID reference optional
- `QMS/SOP/SOP-002.md` - Update Section 8 to make CR ID reference a guideline
- `.claude/agents/qa.md` - Update Review Criteria table
- `qms-cli/prompts/review/default.yaml` - Remove CR ID enforcement
- `qms-cli/prompts/review/review/default.yaml` - Remove CR ID enforcement
- `qms-cli/prompts/review/pre_review/default.yaml` - Remove CR ID enforcement
- `qms-cli/prompts/review/post_review/default.yaml` - Remove CR ID enforcement
- `qms-cli/prompts/approval/default.yaml` - Remove CR ID enforcement

---

## 3. Current State

SOP-001 Section 5.1 states that `revision_summary` "Must begin with the authorizing CR ID for traceability."

SOP-002 Section 8 states that "All document revisions made under a Change Record must reference the CR ID in their `revision_summary` frontmatter field."

The QA agent definition and review prompts enforce this as a hard requirement, treating missing CR IDs as grounds for rejection.

---

## 4. Proposed State

SOP-001 Section 5.1 states that `revision_summary` "should reference the authorizing CR ID when the revision is driven by a CR."

SOP-002 Section 8 provides guidance that CR ID references are recommended for traceability when applicable, with clear exceptions documented.

The QA agent definition and review prompts verify that `revision_summary` is present and descriptive, without requiring a CR ID prefix.

---

## 5. Change Description

### 5.1 SOP-001 Section 5.1 Update

Change the `revision_summary` description from:

> **revision_summary**: Updated each revision cycle to describe changes. Must begin with the authorizing CR ID for traceability (e.g., `CR-004: Add traceability requirement`). Exception: initial document creation (v0.1) does not require a CR ID.

To:

> **revision_summary**: Updated each revision cycle to describe changes. Should reference the authorizing CR ID when the revision is driven by a CR (e.g., `CR-004: Add traceability requirement`). This provides traceability to the change control record. Exceptions where CR ID is not required:
> - Initial document creation (v0.1)
> - Executable documents (CRs, INVs, etc.) which are self-authorizing
> - Revisions not driven by a specific CR

### 5.2 SOP-002 Section 8 Update

Change SOP-002 Section 8 from:

> ## 8. Document Traceability
>
> All document revisions made under a Change Record must reference the CR ID in their `revision_summary` frontmatter field.
>
> **Format:**
> ```yaml
> revision_summary: "CR-XXX: Description of changes"
> ```
>
> **Example:**
> ```yaml
> revision_summary: "CR-004: Add traceability requirement for revision summaries"
> ```
>
> This requirement:
> - Establishes a clear link between document changes and their authorizing CRs
> - Enables audit trails from any document revision back to the change control record
> - Provides context (rationale, approvers, testing) for any historical revision
>
> **Exceptions:**
> - Initial document creation (v0.1) does not require a CR ID
> - Documents created before this policy took effect are grandfathered

To:

> ## 8. Document Traceability
>
> Document revisions driven by a Change Record should reference the CR ID in their `revision_summary` frontmatter field for traceability.
>
> **Recommended Format:**
> ```yaml
> revision_summary: "CR-XXX: Description of changes"
> ```
>
> **Example:**
> ```yaml
> revision_summary: "CR-004: Add traceability requirement for revision summaries"
> ```
>
> **Benefits of CR ID references:**
> - Establishes a clear link between document changes and their authorizing CRs
> - Enables audit trails from any document revision back to the change control record
> - Provides context (rationale, approvers, testing) for any historical revision
>
> **When CR ID is not required:**
> - Initial document creation (v0.1)
> - Executable documents (CRs, INVs, TPs, ERs, VARs) which are self-authorizing
> - Revisions not driven by a specific CR
> - Documents created before this policy took effect

### 5.3 QA Agent Definition Update

Update the Review Criteria table entry for `revision_summary` from:

> Present for v1.0+ documents; begins with CR ID

To:

> Present for v1.0+ documents; descriptive of changes

### 5.4 Review Prompt Updates

Remove the checklist item "`revision_summary:` begins with CR ID" from all review prompts. Keep the requirement that `revision_summary` is present and non-empty.

---

## 6. Justification

- **Problem:** The current requirement creates awkward situations. CRs must reference themselves (circular). Some documents are updated through processes that don't map cleanly to a single CR.
- **Impact of not changing:** Continued friction and potential for reviewers to reject valid documents, or for authors to invent meaningless CR references.
- **Solution:** Making CR ID reference a guideline preserves traceability benefits where they apply naturally, while eliminating friction where they don't.

| `QMS/SOP/SOP-001.md` | Modify | Update Section 5.1 revision_summary description |
| `QMS/SOP/SOP-002.md` | Modify | Update Section 8 to make CR ID a guideline |
| `.claude/agents/qa.md` | Modify | Update Review Criteria table |
| `qms-cli/prompts/review/default.yaml` | Modify | Remove CR ID checklist item |

### 7.3 Other Impacts

None. This change relaxes a requirement; it does not break any existing valid documents.

---

## 8. Testing Summary

- Verify SOP-001 Section 5.1 clearly states CR ID is optional with documented exceptions
- Verify SOP-002 Section 8 frames CR ID as guidance, not requirement
- Verify QA agent definition no longer requires CR ID in revision_summary
- Verify all review prompts no longer enforce CR ID requirement
- Verify existing documents with CR ID references remain valid (backward compatible)
