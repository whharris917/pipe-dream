# CR-025: Refactor QMS CLI with Test Coverage

## 1. Purpose

Refactor the monolithic `qms-cli/qms.py` (2743 lines, 47 functions) into focused modules while establishing unit test coverage as a safety net for current and future changes.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

Independent improvement identified during development. The QMS CLI has grown organically into a single large file that is difficult to navigate and maintain. No parent document drives this change.

- **Parent Document:** None

### 2.2 Changes Summary

- Create a unit test suite for existing QMS CLI functionality
- Extract logical groupings of functions into focused modules
- Reduce `qms.py` to a slim entry point with argparse and dispatch
- Preserve all existing behavior (refactor, not rewrite)

### 2.3 Files Affected

- `qms-cli/qms.py` - Refactor from 2743 lines to ~200 line entry point
- `qms-cli/qms_config.py` - New module for constants, enums, status, transitions
- `qms-cli/qms_auth.py` - New module for user/permission functions
- `qms-cli/qms_paths.py` - New module for path resolution functions
- `qms-cli/qms_io.py` - New module for frontmatter parsing and document I/O
- `qms-cli/qms_templates.py` - New module for template loading and generation
- `qms-cli/qms_commands.py` - New module for command handlers
- `tests/` - New test directory with unit tests

---

## 3. Current State

`qms-cli/qms.py` is a 2743-line monolith containing 21 command handlers and 26 utility functions. No unit tests exist. Supporting modules (`qms_meta.py`, `qms_audit.py`, `qms_schema.py`) already demonstrate the modular pattern.

---

## 4. Proposed State

`qms.py` is a slim entry point (~200 lines) containing only argparse setup and command dispatch. Functionality is distributed across 6 focused modules. A unit test suite provides a safety net for verifying behavior during and after refactoring.

---

## 5. Change Description

### 5.1 Test Infrastructure

Create `tests/` directory with pytest configuration. Write unit tests for key functions *before* extracting them, establishing a baseline that must pass throughout the refactoring.

### 5.2 Module Extraction Strategy

Extract modules incrementally, running tests after each extraction to verify behavior is preserved. The proposed module structure is:

| Module | Approximate Lines | Purpose |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| `qms_config.py` | ~150 | Constants, enums, Status, TRANSITIONS, PERMISSIONS |
| `qms_auth.py` | ~150 | get_current_user, check_permission, verify_user_identity |
| `qms_paths.py` | ~100 | get_doc_path, get_archive_path, get_workspace_path, get_next_number |
| `qms_io.py` | ~150 | parse_frontmatter, serialize_frontmatter, read_document, write_document |
| `qms_templates.py` | ~300 | generate_review_task_content, load_template_for_type |
| `qms_commands.py` | ~1600 | All 21 cmd_* functions |
| `qms.py` | ~200 | Entry point: main(), argparse, command dispatch |

**Note:** These are target estimates. Actual line counts and module boundaries may shift during implementation as better interfaces emerge.

### 5.3 Flexibility Provisions

This CR explicitly allows for iterative refinement during execution:

1. **Module boundary adjustments** - Exact function placements may shift based on dependency analysis
2. **Function signature refinements** - Better interfaces may emerge during testing and extraction
3. **Incremental test coverage** - Tests added iteratively; 100% coverage not required
4. **Iterative pair-coding** - EI structure supports multiple iterations within each extraction phase

The executor may make reasonable adjustments to the implementation details as long as the end state satisfies the objectives: modular code structure and passing tests.

---

## 6. Justification

- **Maintainability:** A 2743-line file is difficult to navigate and understand
- **Testability:** Smaller modules with focused responsibilities are easier to test
- **Collaboration:** Multiple contributors can work on different modules without merge conflicts
- **Consistency:** Existing `qms_meta.py`, `qms_audit.py`, `qms_schema.py` demonstrate the pattern; `qms.py` should follow
- **Risk mitigation:** Unit tests provide safety net for this and future changes

---

## 7. Impact Assessment

### 7.1 Files Affected

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `qms-cli/qms.py` | Modify | Reduce to entry point with argparse and dispatch |
| `qms-cli/qms_config.py` | Create | Constants, enums, state machine definitions |
| `qms-cli/qms_auth.py` | Create | User authentication and permission functions |
| `qms-cli/qms_paths.py` | Create | Path resolution and document location functions |
| `qms-cli/qms_io.py` | Create | Document I/O and frontmatter parsing |
| `qms-cli/qms_templates.py` | Create | Template loading and content generation |
| `qms-cli/qms_commands.py` | Create | All command handler functions |

| `tests/test_qms_io.py` | Create | Unit tests for I/O functions |
| `tests/test_qms_auth.py` | Create | Unit tests for auth functions |

### 7.2 Documents Affected

| Document | Change Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| None | - | No QMS documents affected |

### 7.3 Other Impacts

None. Internal refactoring only; CLI interface and behavior remain unchanged.

---

## 8. Testing Summary

- **Unit tests run before refactoring:** Establish baseline on current monolith
- **Unit tests run after each module extraction:** Verify no regressions
- **Unit tests run after final cleanup:** Comprehensive verification
- **CLI smoke test:** Verify `python qms-cli/qms.py --help` and basic commands work

---

## 9. Implementation Plan

### 9.1 Phase 1: Test Infrastructure

1. Set up pytest and tests/ directory
2. Write unit tests for path functions (targeting current monolith)
3. Write unit tests for I/O functions (targeting current monolith)
4. Write unit tests for auth functions (targeting current monolith)
5. Verify all tests pass on current monolith (baseline)

### 9.2 Phase 2: Module Extraction

6. Extract config module; verify tests pass
7. Extract paths module; verify tests pass
8. Extract I/O module; verify tests pass
9. Extract auth module; verify tests pass
10. Extract templates module; verify tests pass
11. Extract commands module; verify tests pass

### 9.3 Phase 3: Cleanup

12. Final cleanup of qms.py; comprehensive test run

-->

**All 12 execution items completed successfully.**

The monolithic `qms.py` (2743 lines) has been refactored into 7 focused modules:

| Module | Lines | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| qms.py | 206 | Entry point (argparse, dispatch) |
| qms_config.py | 175 | Constants, enums, transitions |
| qms_paths.py | 149 | Path resolution functions |
| qms_io.py | 72 | Document I/O, frontmatter |
| qms_auth.py | 135 | Authentication, permissions |
| qms_templates.py | 312 | Template generation |
| qms_commands.py | 1826 | 21 command implementations |

**Test Coverage:** 59 unit tests (18 auth, 16 I/O, 25 path) all passing.

**Deviation from Plan:** None significant. Test assertions were adjusted to match actual behavior (TP/CAPA path resolution), and conftest.py required module reload ordering to work with temp directories.
