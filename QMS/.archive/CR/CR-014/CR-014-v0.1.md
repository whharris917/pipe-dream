# CR-014: SOP Updates: Execution Mechanics, ER/VAR Exception Handling, and Closure Requirements

## 1. Purpose

This CR implements comprehensive updates to the execution mechanics of the QMS, including:

1. **Simplified execution item outcomes:** Replace PENDING/IN_PROGRESS/COMPLETE/BLOCKED status values with binary Pass/Fail outcomes, aligned with test step execution patterns.

2. **Exception handling framework:** Formalize the distinction between Exception Reports (ERs) for test-specific failures and Variance Reports (VARs) for all other executable documents.

3. **VAR Type 1/Type 2 distinction:** Establish two blocking types that govern how exceptions clear their parent document.

4. **Closure requirements:** Strengthen post-review gates to require all execution items Pass or be documented via ER/VAR.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

This CR consolidates execution mechanics improvements developed during Session-2026-01-06-002, including insights from template development and analysis of EI/test step isomorphism.

- **Parent Document:** None (independent improvement)

### 2.2 Changes Summary

- SOP-004: Major restructure of execution item tracking, exception handling, and closure gates
- SOP-002: Add VAR reference for CR exceptions
- SOP-001: Update definitions, scope, and naming conventions to include VAR

### 2.3 Files Affected

- `QMS/SOP/SOP-004.md` — Major updates to Sections 4, 7, 9, 10
- `QMS/SOP/SOP-002.md` — Minor update to Section 7.3
- `QMS/SOP/SOP-001.md` — Updates to Sections 2, 3, and 6.1

---

## 3. Rationale

The current SOP-004 execution item tracking uses status values (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE, BLOCKED) that:

1. **Are inconsistent with test execution:** Test steps use Pass/Fail, but CRs use status values
2. **Obscure failure modes:** BLOCKED is vague; it doesn't distinguish between "temporarily blocked" and "failed"
3. **Lack formal exception handling:** No structured process for documenting failures in non-test contexts

The isomorphism between EI tables and test step tables reveals they are fundamentally the same pattern:
- Both have static descriptions (what to do) and editable fields (what happened)
- Both require binary outcomes (Pass/Fail)
- Both need exception handling when outcomes are not as expected

By unifying the pattern, we:
- Reduce cognitive load (one pattern to learn)
- Enable VAR concept for all executable documents
- Strengthen closure gates with clear completion criteria

---

## 4. Implementation Plan

### 4.1 SOP-004 Updates

1. **Section 4.2 (Execution Item Table):** Replace status column with Task Outcome (Pass/Fail), add Execution Summary column
2. **Section 7 (Progress Tracking):** Remove status values section, add execution outcome documentation
3. **Section 9 (Exception Reports):** Limit scope to test-specific exceptions (TC/TP context)
4. **New Section 9A (Variance Reports):** Add VAR section for non-test executable documents with Type 1/Type 2 distinction; clarify relationship with SOP-003 (VARs handle execution exceptions in-flight; INVs handle post-hoc quality events)
5. **Section 10 (Post-Review Requirements):** Update closure gate to require Pass or ER/VAR documentation

### 4.2 SOP-002 Updates

1. **Section 7.3 (Post-Review Requirements):** Add VAR reference for CR execution exceptions

### 4.3 SOP-001 Updates

1. **Section 2 (Scope):** Add VAR to list of controlled document types
2. **Section 3 (Definitions):** Add VAR definition to table
3. **Section 6.1 (Document Naming Convention):** Add VAR naming format (child of parent, e.g., CR-014-VAR-001)

---

## 5. Testing Summary

- Manual review of updated SOPs for internal consistency
- Verify cross-references between SOPs are valid
- Confirm VAR/ER distinction is clear and unambiguous

EXECUTION PHASE INSTRUCTIONS
============================
NOTE: Do NOT delete this comment block. It provides guidance for execution.

- Sections 1-5 are PRE-APPROVED content — do NOT modify during execution
- Only THIS TABLE and the comment sections below should be edited during execution phase

COLUMNS:
- EI: Execution item identifier
- Task Description: What to do (static, from Implementation Plan)
- Execution Summary: Narrative of what was done, evidence, observations (editable)
- Task Outcome: Pass or Fail (editable)
- Performed By — Date: Signature (editable)

TASK OUTCOME:
- Pass: Task completed as planned
- Fail: Task could not be completed as planned — attach VAR with explanation

VAR TYPES (per SOP-004 Section 9A, to be added by this CR):
- Type 1: Full closure of VAR required to clear block on parent
- Type 2: Pre-approval of VAR sufficient to clear block on parent
