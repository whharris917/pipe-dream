TEMPLATE DOCUMENT NOTICE
================================================================================
This template is a QMS-controlled document. The frontmatter contains only:
- title: Document title
- revision_summary: Description of changes in this revision

All other metadata (version, status, responsible_user, dates) is managed
automatically by the QMS CLI in sidecar files (.meta/) per SOP-001 Section 5.

When creating a CR from this template, copy from the EXAMPLE FRONTMATTER onward.

TEMPLATE USAGE GUIDE
================================================================================

DOCUMENT TYPE:
CRs are EXECUTABLE documents that authorize implementation activities.

WORKFLOW:
  DRAFT -> IN_PRE_REVIEW -> PRE_REVIEWED -> IN_PRE_APPROVAL -> PRE_APPROVED
       -> IN_EXECUTION -> IN_POST_REVIEW -> POST_REVIEWED -> IN_POST_APPROVAL
       -> POST_APPROVED -> CLOSED

PLACEHOLDER TYPES:
1. {{DOUBLE_CURLY}} - Replace when DRAFTING (before routing for review)
2. [SQUARE_BRACKETS] - Replace during EXECUTION (after release)

After authoring:
- NO {{...}} placeholders should remain
- All [...] placeholders should remain until execution

Authors may define additional execution placeholders as needed. Use square
brackets for any field that must be filled during execution.

ID FORMAT:
  CR-NNN
  Example: CR-001, CR-015

LOCKED vs EDITABLE:
- Sections 1-9 are locked after pre-approval
- Sections 10-12 are editable during execution
- Section 13 may be updated to add references discovered during execution

STRUCTURE (per SOP-002 Section 6):
Pre-Approved Content (locked after pre-approval):
  1. Purpose
  2. Scope (Context, Changes Summary, Files Affected)
  3. Current State
  4. Proposed State
  5. Change Description
  6. Justification
  7. Impact Assessment
  8. Testing Summary
  9. Implementation Plan

Execution Content (editable during execution):
  10. Execution (EI table, comments)
  11. Execution Summary
  12. References

CODE CR PATTERNS:
When a CR modifies controlled code (any system with SDLC governance):
- Include Section 7.4 (Development Controls) and 7.5 (Qualified State Continuity)
- Use the standardized implementation phases in Section 9
- RS and RTM must be EFFECTIVE before merging to main (SOP-006 Section 7.4)
- The qualified commit is the execution branch commit verified by CI (SOP-005 Section 7.1.2)
- RTM must reference this execution branch commit hash -- not the merge commit
- Merge type: regular merge commit (--no-ff). Squash merges are prohibited (SOP-005 Section 7.1.3)
- Qualification happens on the execution branch; main stays qualified throughout

The pattern ensures:
- main branch is always in a qualified state
- No code merges without approved requirements and passing tests
- The qualified commit hash in the RTM is reachable on main via merge commit
- Full traceability from requirements to verified implementation

{{PURPOSE - What problem does this CR solve? What improvement does it introduce?}}

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

{{CONTEXT - Reference parent investigation, CAPA, or driving document. If none, state the origin of this change (e.g., "Independent improvement identified during development" or "User-requested enhancement").}}

- **Parent Document:** {{PARENT_DOC_ID or "None"}}

### 2.2 Changes Summary

{{CHANGES_SUMMARY - Brief description of what will change}}

### 2.3 Files Affected

{{FILES_AFFECTED - List each file and describe changes}}

- `{{path/to/file1}}` - {{description of changes}}
- `{{path/to/file2}}` - {{description of changes}}

---

## 3. Current State

{{CURRENT_STATE - Concise declarative statement(s) describing what exists now. Use present tense.}}

---

## 4. Proposed State

{{PROPOSED_STATE - Concise declarative statement(s) describing what will exist after the change. Use present tense.}}

---

## 5. Change Description

{{CHANGE_DESCRIPTION - Full technical details of the change. Structure is flexible based on complexity.}}

### 5.1 {{Component/Area 1}}

{{Details for this component}}

### 5.2 {{Component/Area 2}}

{{Details for this component}}

---

## 6. Justification

{{JUSTIFICATION - Why is this change needed?}}

- {{The problem being solved or improvement being made}}
- {{Impact of not making this change}}
- {{How the proposed solution addresses the root cause}}

---

## 7. Impact Assessment

### 7.1 Files Affected

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `{{path/to/file}}` | {{Create/Modify/Delete}} | {{Brief description}} |

### 7.2 Documents Affected

| Document | Change Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| {{DOC-ID}} | {{Create/Modify}} | {{Brief description}} |

### 7.3 Other Impacts

{{OTHER_IMPACTS - External systems, interfaces, dependencies, or "None"}}

### 7.4 Development Controls

<!--
Include this section when the CR modifies controlled code.
Delete this section for document-only CRs.
-->

This CR implements changes to {{SYSTEM}}, a controlled {{submodule/codebase}}. Development follows established controls:

1. **Test environment isolation:** Development in a non-QMS-controlled directory (e.g., `.test-env/`, `/projects/` for containerized agents, or other gitignored location)
2. **Branch isolation:** All development on branch `{{BRANCH_NAME}}`
3. **Write protection:** `.claude/settings.local.json` blocks direct writes to `{{SYSTEM}}/`
4. **Qualification required:** All new/modified requirements must have passing tests before merge
5. **CI verification:** Tests must pass on GitHub Actions for dev branch
6. **PR gate:** Changes merge to main only via PR after RS/RTM approval
7. **Submodule update:** Parent repo updates pointer only after PR merge

### 7.5 Qualified State Continuity

<!--
Include this section when the CR modifies controlled code.
Delete this section for document-only CRs.
-->

| Phase | main branch | RS/RTM Status | Qualified Release |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Before CR | Current commit | EFFECTIVE v{{N}}.0 | {{SYS}}-{{M}}.0 |
| During execution | Unchanged | DRAFT (checked out) | {{SYS}}-{{M}}.0 (unchanged) |
| Post-approval | Merged from {{BRANCH}} | EFFECTIVE v{{N+1}}.0 | {{SYS}}-{{M+1}}.0 |

## 8. Testing Summary

{{TESTING - Describe how the implementation will be verified}}

- {{Test case 1}}
- {{Test case 2}}
- {{Test case 3}}

---

## 9. Implementation Plan

<!--
For code CRs, use these standardized phases. Adjust as needed.
For document-only CRs, simplify to relevant steps.
-->

{{IMPLEMENTATION - Detailed plan for executing the change}}

### 9.1 Phase 1: Test Environment Setup

<!--
Include for code CRs. Delete for document-only CRs.
-->

1. Verify/create a non-QMS-controlled working directory (e.g., `.test-env/`, `/projects/`, or other appropriate location)
2. Clone/update {{SYSTEM}} from GitHub
3. Create and checkout branch `{{BRANCH_NAME}}`
4. Verify clean test environment

### 9.2 Phase 2: Requirements (RS Update)

<!--
Include for code CRs that add/modify requirements. Delete if not applicable.
-->

1. Checkout SDLC-{{NS}}-RS in production QMS
2. Add/modify requirements as needed
3. Checkin RS, route for review and approval

### 9.3 Phase 3: Implementation

1. Implement changes per Change Description
2. Test locally
3. Commit to dev branch

### 9.4 Phase 4: Qualification

<!--
Include for code CRs. Delete for document-only CRs.
-->

1. Add/update qualification tests
2. Run full test suite, verify all tests pass
3. Push to dev branch
4. Verify GitHub Actions CI passes
5. Document qualified commit hash

### 9.5 Phase 5: RTM Update and Approval

<!--
Include for code CRs that add/modify requirements. Delete if not applicable.
-->

1. Checkout SDLC-{{NS}}-RTM in production QMS
2. Add verification evidence referencing CI-verified commit
3. Checkin RTM, route for review and approval
4. **Verify RTM reaches EFFECTIVE status before proceeding to Phase 6**

### 9.6 Phase 6: Merge and Submodule Update

<!--
Include for code CRs. Delete for document-only CRs.
-->

**Prerequisite:** RS and RTM must both be EFFECTIVE before proceeding (per SOP-006 Section 7.4).

1. Verify RS is EFFECTIVE (document status check)
2. Verify RTM is EFFECTIVE (document status check)
3. Create PR to merge dev branch to main
4. Merge PR using merge commit -- not squash (per SOP-005 Section 7.1.3)
5. Verify qualified commit hash from execution branch is reachable on main
6. Update submodule pointer in parent repo
7. Verify functionality in production context

### 9.7 Phase 7: Documentation (if applicable)
