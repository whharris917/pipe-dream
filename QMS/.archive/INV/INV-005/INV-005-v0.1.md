# INV-005: Locked Section Edit During Execution

## 1. Purpose

Investigate unauthorized modification of locked document sections during execution phase.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

During CR-036 work, an attempt to expand VAR-002's scope resulted in editing sections that should have been locked.

- **Triggering Event:** Modification of CR-036-VAR-002 Sections 2-6 while document was IN_EXECUTION
- **Related Document:** CR-036-VAR-002

### 2.2 Deviation Type

- **Type:** Procedural

### 2.3 Systems/Documents Affected

- `CR-036-VAR-002` - Locked sections modified during execution
- `qms-cli` - Did not prevent the modification

---

## 3. Background

### 3.1 Expected Behavior

Per SOP-004 and VAR template guidance, Sections 1-6 of a VAR are locked after pre-approval. Only Section 7 (Resolution Work) and Section 8 (Closure) should be editable during execution.

### 3.2 Actual Behavior

The CLI allowed checkout of CR-036-VAR-002 while IN_EXECUTION, and the Edit tool modified Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The checkin succeeded without warning.

### 3.3 Discovery

The Lead identified the violation immediately after checkin by noting that VAR-002 was already IN_EXECUTION before checkout.

### 3.4 Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2026-01-25 | CR-036-VAR-002 reached IN_EXECUTION status (v1.0) |
| 2026-01-25 | Claude checked out VAR-002 and modified Sections 2-6 |
| 2026-01-25 | Claude checked in VAR-002 |
| 2026-01-25 | Lead identified the process violation |

## 4. Description of Deviation(s)

### 4.1 Facts and Observations

1. CR-036-VAR-002 was IN_EXECUTION (v1.0, pre-approved)
2. `qms checkout CR-036-VAR-002` succeeded
3. Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were edited to add "Issue Category 3: Partial Test Coverage Pattern"
4. `qms checkin CR-036-VAR-002` succeeded without error or warning
5. The locked section content was overwritten in the QMS

### 4.2 Evidence

- VAR-002 status before checkout: IN_EXECUTION
- Modified sections: 2 (Detailed Description), 3 (Root Cause), 4 (Variance Type), 5 (Impact Assessment), 6 (Proposed Resolution)

---

## 5. Impact Assessment

### 5.1 Systems Affected

| System | Impact | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| qms-cli | Medium | Does not enforce section locking |

### 5.2 Documents Affected

| Document | Impact | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| CR-036-VAR-002 | High | Locked sections corrupted; must be reverted |

### 5.3 Other Impacts

None - caught immediately before further downstream work.

---

## 6. Root Cause Analysis

### 6.1 Contributing Factors

- The CLI does not enforce section-level locking
- Claude was not aware VAR-002 was already in execution when accepting the task
- The Edit tool has no knowledge of QMS document structure or lock status

### 6.2 Root Cause(s)

**Primary:** The qms-cli lacks programmatic enforcement of section locking during checkout/checkin of documents in execution phase.

**Secondary:** Operator did not verify document status before accepting modification task.

| CAPA | Type | Description | Implementation | Outcome | Verified By - Date |
|------|------|-------------|----------------|---------|---------------------|
| INV-005-CAPA-001 | Corrective | Revert CR-036-VAR-002 to pre-violation state | [IMPLEMENTATION] | [Pass/Fail] | [VERIFIER] - [DATE] |
| INV-005-CAPA-002 | Preventive | Investigate programmatic section locking in qms-cli | [IMPLEMENTATION] | [Pass/Fail] | [VERIFIER] - [DATE] |
