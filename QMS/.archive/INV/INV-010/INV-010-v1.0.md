# INV-010: CR-050 Closed Before RTM Approval - Prerequisite Gate Ambiguity

## 1. Purpose

This investigation examines whether closing CR-050 before SDLC-QMS-RTM reached EFFECTIVE status constitutes a procedural deviation, and identifies gaps in current procedures around prerequisite stage gates for SDLC qualification.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Context

During CR-050 closure, the SDLC-QMS-RTM was updated with the verified commit hash (63123fe) but remained in DRAFT status. The RTM was subsequently routed for review and approval *after* CR-050 was already CLOSED. The Lead observed that this sequencing may violate the principle that a system is not "qualified" until its RTM is EFFECTIVE.

- **Triggering Event:** Lead observation during Session 2026-02-02-003
- **Related Document:** CR-050 (CLOSED)

### 2.2 Deviation Type

- **Type:** Procedural (process gap, not deviation)

The CR-050 closure was technically compliant with current procedures. However, the procedures themselves lack explicit prerequisite gates for SDLC qualification. This investigation focuses on preventive actions to close the gap.

### 2.3 Systems/Documents Affected

- `CR-050` - Closed before RTM approved
- `SDLC-QMS-RTM` - Approved after CR closed (now EFFECTIVE v9.0)
- `SOP-006` - SDLC Governance (may lack explicit prerequisite gates)
- `SOP-002` - Change Control (CR closure criteria may be incomplete)
- `TEMPLATE-CR` - May lack explicit SDLC document approval gate

## 3. Background

### 3.1 Expected Behavior

For an SDLC system (qms-cli) to be considered "qualified":
1. Code changes are CI-verified and merged to main
2. Requirements Specification (RS) reflects implemented requirements (EFFECTIVE)
3. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) documents verification of all requirements against a specific commit (EFFECTIVE)
4. The CR implementing these changes is CLOSED only after both RS and RTM are EFFECTIVE

### 3.2 Actual Behavior

The sequence during CR-050 closure was:

1. Code merged to main with CI verification (commit 63123fe, 364/364 tests)
2. SDLC-QMS-RTM v8.1 updated with commit hash and checked in (DRAFT status)
3. CR-050 EI-6 marked as Pass ("Update RTM with verified commit")
4. CR-050 routed for post-review, approved, and CLOSED (v2.0)
5. *Then* SDLC-QMS-RTM routed for review and approval (v9.0 EFFECTIVE)

### 3.3 Discovery

The Lead observed the sequencing issue immediately after the RTM approval and raised it as a potential deviation requiring investigation.

### 3.4 Timeline

| Date/Time (UTC) | Event |
|-----------------|-------|
| 2026-02-02 23:02:14 | CI run 21609392809 passes on main (364/364 tests) |
| 2026-02-02 23:07:35 | SDLC-QMS-RTM v8.1 checked in (DRAFT) |
| 2026-02-02 23:08:46 | CR-050 routed for post-review |
| 2026-02-02 23:10:27 | CR-050 approved (v2.0) |
| 2026-02-02 23:11:06 | CR-050 CLOSED |
| 2026-02-02 23:12:07 | SDLC-QMS-RTM routed for review |
| 2026-02-02 23:15:01 | SDLC-QMS-RTM approved (v9.0 EFFECTIVE) |

## 4. Description of Deviation(s)

### 4.1 Facts and Observations

**Observation 1: CR-050 EI-6 Was Ambiguous**

CR-050 EI-6 stated: "Update RTM with verified commit"

The execution summary recorded: "Updated SDLC-QMS-RTM v8.1: Branch=main, Commit=63123fe, Tests=364/364."

This was interpreted as "edit the RTM content" rather than "ensure RTM reaches EFFECTIVE status."

**Observation 2: Current Procedures Do Not Explicitly Require RTM EFFECTIVE Before CR Closure**

Reviewing the governing SOPs:
- SOP-002 (Change Control) defines CR closure criteria but does not mention SDLC document status
- SOP-006 (SDLC Governance) defines RTM requirements but does not tie them to CR closure gates
- TEMPLATE-CR does not include an explicit execution item for "RTM approved to EFFECTIVE"

**Observation 3: The System Was Technically Unqualified When CR-050 Closed**

Per SOP-006 Section 5.1: "The RTM provides traceability between requirements and their verification."

An SDLC system is qualified when its RTM is EFFECTIVE. At the moment CR-050 closed (23:11:06), the RTM was still DRAFT, meaning qms-cli was technically unqualified for approximately 4 minutes until RTM approval (23:15:01).

### 4.2 Evidence

- **CR-050 v2.0 (CLOSED):** EI-6 says "Update RTM with verified commit" - no explicit approval gate
- **SDLC-QMS-RTM audit trail:** Shows APPROVE event occurred after CR-050 CLOSE event
- **SOP-002:** No mention of SDLC document status as CR closure prerequisite
- **SOP-006:** No explicit tie between RTM approval and CR closure
- **TEMPLATE-CR:** No execution item template for "Route RTM for approval; verify EFFECTIVE"

## 5. Impact Assessment

### 5.1 Systems Affected

| System | Impact | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| qms-cli | Low | Technically unqualified for ~4 minutes; now properly qualified |

### 5.2 Documents Affected

| Document | Impact | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| CR-050 | Medium | Closed with implicit rather than explicit RTM gate |
| SDLC-QMS-RTM | Low | Approved after CR closed; now EFFECTIVE |
| SOP-002 | Medium | Lacks explicit SDLC prerequisite gate |
| SOP-006 | Medium | Lacks explicit tie to CR closure |
| TEMPLATE-CR | Medium | Lacks RTM approval execution item |

### 5.3 Other Impacts

- **Process Integrity:** The gap could allow future CRs to close before SDLC documents are approved
- **Qualification Claims:** A CR claiming "system qualified" is premature if RTM is not yet EFFECTIVE
- **Recursive Governance:** The QMS governing SDLC governance itself has this gap

## 6. Root Cause Analysis

### 6.1 Contributing Factors

1. **Ambiguous EI Wording:** "Update RTM" does not explicitly mean "ensure RTM is EFFECTIVE"
2. **No Explicit Stage Gate:** Neither SOP-002 nor SOP-006 defines RTM EFFECTIVE as a CR closure prerequisite
3. **Template Gap:** TEMPLATE-CR does not include RTM approval as a standard execution item
4. **Session Momentum:** The desire to complete work within a session led to rapid sequencing
5. **Implicit Assumption:** The executor (claude) assumed RTM approval would follow naturally and didn't treat it as a blocking gate

### 6.2 Root Cause(s)

**Primary Root Cause: Missing Explicit Prerequisite Gate in Procedures**

The QMS procedures do not explicitly state that for CRs affecting SDLC-governed systems:
- The RS must be EFFECTIVE before the CR can be closed
- The RTM must be EFFECTIVE before the CR can be closed

This is a systemic gap, not an individual execution error. The executor followed the CR's execution items as written; the execution items themselves were incomplete.

**Secondary Root Cause: SDLC Governance Isolation**

SOP-006 (SDLC Governance) operates somewhat independently of SOP-002 (Change Control). There is no explicit integration point that says "when a CR affects an SDLC-governed system, the following additional gates apply."
