# INV-001: CR-005 Scope Deviation - SOP Changes Not Executed

## 1. Purpose

Investigate how CR-005 was post-approved and closed without executing all items in the pre-approved scope, specifically the SOP-001 and SOP-002 changes.

---

## 2. Scope

This investigation examines:
- The pre-approved scope of CR-005
- The actual execution performed
- QA's rationale for recommending post-approval with incomplete scope
- Whether proper change control procedures were followed
- Whether a procedural nonconformance occurred

---

## 3. Background

CR-005 was created to address documentation fixes, QA permissions, and an archive bug. The CR was pre-approved on 2026-01-04 and closed the same day.

---

## 4. Evidence Review

### 4.1 Pre-Approved Scope (CR-005 Section 2)

The pre-approved CR explicitly listed these documents in scope:

> This change affects:
> - **qa.md** - Fix incorrect section reference
> - **CLAUDE.md** - Fix misleading cross-reference
> - **bu.md** - Align effective date with other agents
> - **SOP-002** - Clarify CR ID reuse policy
> - **CR template** - Remove manual metadata fields and revision history table
> - **SOP-001** - Grant QA route permission
> - **qms.py** - Allow qa user to execute route command; archive effective version on checkout

### 4.2 Pre-Approved Execution Plan (CR-005 Section 4)

The execution plan explicitly stated:

> 1. Edit qa.md to fix section reference
> 2. Edit CLAUDE.md to remove incorrect SOP-002 reference
> 3. Edit bu.md to align effective date
> 4. **Edit SOP-002 to clarify ID reuse policy**
> 5. Edit CR template in qms.py to remove manual metadata fields
> 6. **Checkout SOP-001, update permission matrix to grant QA route permission**
> 7. Update qms.py ALLOWED_ACTIONS to include route for qa user
> 8. Update qms.py cmd_checkout() to archive effective version before creating draft

Items 4 and 6 (emphasized) were NOT executed.

### 4.3 QA Pre-Review Comment

At 03:17:05, QA reviewed and recommended approval, verifying all seven changes and noting:

> "No TU reviewers required - changes are documentation fixes and QMS infrastructure code"

QA confirmed all changes including SOP-002 and SOP-001.

### 4.4 First Post-Review (UPDATES_REQUIRED)

At 03:40:04, QA correctly identified the incomplete execution:

> "Post-review: Execution substantially incomplete. Only 1 of 8 planned changes was implemented...
> The remaining 7 changes were blocked: 5 by Edit tool errors (qa.md, bu.md, qms.py x3) and
> **2 by QMS workflow requirements (SOP-001, SOP-002)**."

This was correct - the SOP changes were not executed.

### 4.5 Revert and Retry

The CR was reverted to IN_EXECUTION at 03:40:32 with reason: "Retrying blocked changes with alternative approach."

### 4.6 Second Post-Review (RECOMMEND)

At 03:49:43, after retry, QA recommended approval with this statement:

> "The two SOP changes (SOP-002 CR ID reuse clarification and SOP-001 permission matrix update)
> **correctly require separate QMS revision workflows and are out of scope for code execution**.
> Recommend approval."

**This is the critical finding.** QA declared the SOP changes "out of scope" despite:
- SOP-002 and SOP-001 being explicitly listed in Section 2 (Scope)
- Items 4 and 6 being in the Execution Plan (Section 4)
- QA having verified these same items in pre-review

---

## 5. Findings

### Finding 1: Scope Was Not Amended

The CR was closed with items in the pre-approved scope incomplete. No formal scope amendment was made to CR-005 to remove items 4 and 6 from the execution plan. The CR document still lists SOP-001 and SOP-002 as in-scope.

### Finding 2: QA Rationale Was Incorrect

QA stated the SOP changes "correctly require separate QMS revision workflows and are out of scope for code execution."

This rationale is flawed:
- **The items were IN scope** - explicitly listed in Sections 2 and 4
- **QA verified them in pre-review** - confirming they were part of the approved plan
- **"Require separate workflows" is a constraint, not a scope exclusion** - if the CR couldn't deliver these items, the CR scope should have been formally amended

### Finding 3: No Explicit Approval to Deviate

The audit trail shows no explicit decision to:
- Amend CR-005 scope to remove SOP items
- Create follow-up CRs for the incomplete items
- Document why the deviation was acceptable

QA simply rationalized the incomplete execution as "out of scope" without procedural justification.

### Finding 4: CR Title/Scope Mismatch

The closed CR-005 still has:
- Title: "Documentation fixes, QA permissions, and archive bug"
- Scope listing SOP-001 and SOP-002
- Execution plan with items 4 and 6

But these items were not delivered.

---

## 6. Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause

**Inadequate scope change control during execution.** When execution encountered obstacles (Edit tool issues, QMS controlled document restrictions), the response was to rationalize the incomplete work rather than formally amend the CR scope.

### Contributing Factors

1. **Time pressure** - CR-005 was created, pre-approved, executed, and closed within a single session
2. **Convenience over compliance** - Easier to rationalize than to formally amend the scope
3. **Ambiguous CR structure** - CR-005 mixed code changes with SOP revisions, creating confusion about what "execution" meant
4. **QA oversight** - QA accepted the rationalization without requiring formal scope amendment

---

## 7. Questions for QA

1. Why were SOP-001 and SOP-002 changes accepted as "out of scope" when they were explicitly listed in the pre-approved scope?

2. Why was no formal scope amendment requested or documented?

3. Was there a conscious decision to proceed with incomplete scope, or was this an oversight?

4. Should CR-005 have been closed with incomplete scope items, or should follow-up CRs have been required first?

---

## 8. Potential Procedural Nonconformances

### 8.1 SOP-002 Section [TBD] - Scope Changes

If SOP-002 requires formal documentation of scope changes during execution, this may be a nonconformance.

### 8.2 Post-Approval with Incomplete Execution

Approving a CR as "complete" when documented scope items were not executed may violate change control principles.

---

## 9. QA Response

QA reviewed INV-001 and provided the following responses:

### 9.1 Response to Questions

**Q1: Why were SOP-001 and SOP-002 changes accepted as "out of scope"?**

QA acknowledged the rationale was flawed. The items were explicitly in-scope (listed in Sections 2 and 4, verified in pre-review) but QA incorrectly stated they were "out of scope for code execution" when they were in-scope items requiring a different execution mechanism (QMS-controlled document revision).

**Q2: Why was no formal scope amendment requested or documented?**

No formal amendment was requested. QA rationalized acceptance rather than requiring proper handling.

**Q3: Was this a conscious decision or oversight?**

QA confirmed this was a conscious decision with flawed reasoning - explicitly acknowledging the items were undelivered but rationalizing acceptance.

**Q4: Should CR-005 have been closed with incomplete scope?**

No. The deferred SOP changes should have been tracked and completed through properly scoped follow-up CRs before CR-005 closure, or the CR scope should have been formally amended.

### 9.2 QA Conclusion

**Procedural nonconformance confirmed.** CR-005 was approved and closed with incomplete scope items, which violates change control principles.

## 10. Recommended Actions

### Corrective Actions

1. **CR-006**: Create follow-up CR for SOP-001 permission matrix update (grant QA route permission)
2. **CR-007**: Create follow-up CR for SOP-002 ID reuse policy clarification

### Preventive Actions

3. **CAPA-001**: Develop preventive measures to avoid future scope deviations:
   - Add explicit scope change control procedure to SOP-002
   - Require QA to flag incomplete scope items during post-review
   - Require follow-up CR creation before closing parent CR with incomplete items

---

## 11. Associated Documents
